# A semantic network analysis of altered time perception in 21,548 psychoactive substance reports

Consider these quotes: 

> "As to the 'present', well ... perhaps the true line of our perceived travel in time through reality is just going outwards, from the centre of a circle towards the circumference, on an infinite lollipop candy-like spiral; lines in the spiral all featuring eternities of time itself in various repetitions, and the travel in reality prime just being a movement from one candy-line of infinite possibilities to the next, along only one given instance of each realised possibility."

> "At one point I asked how long it had been and I received the answer "5 minutes", that was after some eternities."
 
These are quotes from a psychoactive substance report from the [Erowid Experience Vault] (https://erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml/) [^1].
Within, the total of nearly 40,000 reports, there are ten-to-hundred of thousands mentions of phrases indicative of altered time perception. Let's go explore them!
