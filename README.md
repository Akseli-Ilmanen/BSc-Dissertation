# A semantic network analysis of altered time perception in 21,548 psychoactive substance reports

Consider these quotes: 
> "As to the 'present', well ... perhaps the true line of our perceived travel in time through reality is just going outwards, from the centre of a circle towards     the circumference, on an infinite lollipop candy-like spiral; lines in the spiral all featuring eternities of time itself in various repetitions, and the travel in     reality prime just being a movement from one candy-line of infinite possibilities to the next, along only one given instance of each realised possibility."
 
 > "At one point I asked how long it had been and I received the answer "5 minutes", that was after some eternities."

These are quotes from a psychoactive substance report from the [Erowid Experience Vault](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml/).[^1] Within, the total of nearly 40,000 reports, there are ten-to-hundred of thousands mentions of phrases indicative of altered time perception. Let's go explore them!

## Context-window co-occurence network: Method

This diagram explain the main idea of this method briefly.

## Context-window co-occurence network: Example

Below is a co-occurence network with seed words determining the colour. For an interactive similar version, click [here](https://akseli-ilmanen.github.io/Online-Gephi-Test/network). The interactive version works only on a browser not on a phone. The clustering algorithm applied is similar but there nodes and edges are coloured not by seed word but by their local cluster.

These graphs are created in Gephi[^4], using the modularity clustering algorithm[^5] and the 'Circle Pack' layout plugin. The colour gradient labelling was created using a Sigmoid function, passing through the origin. (More details coming soon).

## Edge filtering problem[^2] 

The graph above consists of 799 nodges 9,288 edges. This is a subset of all the possible 13,870 nodges 1,091,046 edges that were collected using the method above (context window = 4). To create the smaller and more meaningful graph, edges were filtered following step 1 and 2. 

### Step 1: Excluding edges based of word types
 1) All self-connections - ['perception', 'perception']
 3) All edges including a seed word  - ['time', 'moment']
 4) All edges including a word not in the Concreteness_ratings_Brysbaert Corpus[^3] ['looong', 'moment']

### Step 2: Excluding edges based of relative frequency and [betweeness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality)

More details coming soon!
