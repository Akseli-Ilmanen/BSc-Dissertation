# BSc-Dissertation - Time Perception Co-Occurence Network

Consider these quotes: 

> As to the "present", well ... perhaps the true line of our perceived travel in time through reality is just going outwards, from the centre of a circle towards the circumference, on an infinite lollipop candy-like spiral; lines in the spiral all featuring eternities of time itself in various repetitions, and the travel in reality prime just being a movement from one candy-line of infinite possibilities to the next, along only one given instance of each realised possibility.

> At one point I asked how long it had been and I received the answer "5 minutes", that was after some eternities.
