# A semantic network analysis of altered time perception in 21,548 psychoactive substance reports

Consider these quotes: 
> "As to the 'present', well ... perhaps the true line of our perceived travel in time through reality is just going outwards, from the centre of a circle towards     the circumference, on an infinite lollipop candy-like spiral; lines in the spiral all featuring eternities of time itself in various repetitions, and the travel in     reality prime just being a movement from one candy-line of infinite possibilities to the next, along only one given instance of each realised possibility."
 
 > "At one point I asked how long it had been and I received the answer "5 minutes", that was after some eternities."

These are quotes from a psychoactive substance report from the [Erowid Experience Vault](https://erowid.org/experiences/exp_front.shtml/).[^1] Within, the total of nearly 40,000 reports, there are ten-to-hundred of thousands mentions of phrases indicative of altered time perception. Let's go explore them!

## Context-window co-occurence network: Method

This diagram should explain the main idea of this method. Soon, I will add more details about the implementation, and how I created the graph below.

## Context-window co-occurence network: Example

Below is a co-occurence network with seed words determining the colour. For an interactive similar version, click [here](https://akseli-ilmanen.github.io/Online-Gephi-Test/network). The clustering algorithm applied is similar but there nodes and edges are coloured not by seed word but by their local cluster.

*This graph was created with Gephi* [^2]


## Link (edge) filtering problem[^3]

The graph above consists of XXXXX nodges XXXXX edges. This is a subset of all the possible XXXXX nodges XXXXX edges. To create the smaller and more meaningful graph, edges were filtered based of the following criteria: 

#### Step 1: Excluding edges
 1) All self-connections - ['perception', 'perception']
 2) All edges (word pairs) including a non-noun. - ['feel', 'heart']
 3) All edges including a seed word  - ['time', 'moment']
 4) All edges including a word not in the Concreteness_ratings_Brysbaert Corpus[^4] ['looong', 'moment']

#### Step 2: Relative frequency - centrality trade off

Equation 1 and 2 are used to determine which edges to exclude. 

1) Using min-max normalization, weights, degree, betweeness centrality and relative frequency were all between [0, 1].

2) Equation 1:
$$S(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-kx}} - 0.5$$

This is a [sigmoid function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) passing through the origin. 
<br>

3) Equation 2: 
$$w^{'} = S(w) * S(deg_{1}) * S(deg_{2}) * S(bc_{1}) * S(bc_{2}) * (rf_{1} * rf_{2})^{1/a}$$

$w^{'}$ and $w$ are the updated and original edge weight.$bc_{n}$ and $deg_{n}$ and $(rf_{n}$ refer to the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)), [betweeness centrality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrality#Betweenness_centrality), and relative frequency of node_{n}. The relative frequency $rf$ is the fraction of a word's frequency in all the context windows compared to the entire corpus. $rf$ is similar to [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf).
<br>

4) Exclude edges by the threshold for their updated weight $w^{'}$.
