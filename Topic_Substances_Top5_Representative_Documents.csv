8883,24_myristica spp.,24,myristica spp.,Stimulants,and laughing alone in my room like a complete nutter . i do know how long that went on for it could been minutes or two hours later when i realized
8884,40_2c-b,40,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,as t a and b . a cousin d who i have known for very long but am beginning to form a strong friendship with was also interested . none of

8886,40_myristica spp.,40,myristica spp.,Stimulants,way up at this point and i agreed wholeheartedly . after the next hour had passed we were both being pounded by the intensity of the some strange experiences followed .
8887,40_myristica spp.,40,myristica spp.,Stimulants,watching the fire we could really have conversations because when on nutmeg i have no short term memory and the talks we had usually ended up in babbling nonsense and not

8889,37_myristica spp.,37,myristica spp.,Stimulants,very high from the nutmeg and a bit concerned so i spent a lot of time taking care of her but she got through alright . i think key to doing
8890,40_myristica spp.,40,myristica spp.,Stimulants,lots of my mother friends most of which i did know very well but very quickly i started blabbing away to them about nothing in particular i just wanted to talk
8891,58_myristica spp.,58,myristica spp.,Stimulants,i got to school i still could nt keep my composure . from placeholder to period it got worse . during lunch some wannabe potheads told the resource officer that i
8892,23_2c-b,23,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,cigarette i took it . it seemed a little more comfortable than usual and the brisk winter night felt comforting and like an enjoyable change of scenery rather than something to
8893,69_myristica spp.,69,myristica spp.,Stimulants,simply could not commit to writing the whole thing the it was just taking too long or was time escaping and i was feeling to good to bother with it anymore
8894,47_myristica spp.,47,myristica spp.,Stimulants,want to get there trust me p anyways the effects seemed to increase ever so slowly with time until i was finally fully able to realize that i was in fact

8905,70_myristica spp.,70,myristica spp.,Stimulants,knowing what to expect is probably a leading cause of the paranoia . also the long wait for effects to appear lulls the user into a sense of complacency followed by
8906,29_myristica spp.,29,myristica spp.,Stimulants,i never experienced any ill effects from doses as high as seeds in a hour period . as always your mileage may vary just because i gotten away with it so

9914,50_mdma,50,mdma,Entactogens,pulled out a glass bong and took hits from it . i figured out pretty quickly that it was meth . i was offered hits a couple times but turned it
9915,43_mdma,43,mdma,Entactogens,i can say i returned to normal but the flashes still happen from placeholder to time i catch myself sitting with a completely blank mind staring at the wall or reading

9922,26_mdma,26,mdma,Entactogens,strange but mind expanding and beautiful as well . after a while i could no longer concentrate well enough to be entranced by these intricate thought patterns . i began to
9923,43_mdma,43,mdma,Entactogens,same negative physical feeling so i would look down in my lap and it would pass immediately . i kept testing my vision looking up after a few mins and the

9929,90_lsd,90,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,least harm . i was truly humble . i wish i could have stayed there longer . eventually i was firmly back in my comfortable familiar ego space despite the experience
9930,13_2c-d,13,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,pretty funny but more race humor . by the video which happened to be way longer than the other ones i was starting to get kind of pissed off . the

9937,16_2c-d,16,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,like it would be a great potentiator of other psychedelics or good to extend the duration of them at least . taking some a while after taking another drug would probably
9938,1_lsd,1,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,some readers out but for some reason my automatic breathing ended up breathing out quite slowly and only when it became obvious to me i needed to inhale i breathed in
9939,33_2c-d,33,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,' so i smoked a couple bowls watched a couple episodes of the simpsons and passed out with no problem just over hours after taking the all in all i would
9940,48_lsd,48,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,sweet coca separately very nice indeed and very refreshing . later maybe an hour had passed i know for sure we decided to go to the arcade saloon and things got
9941,14_lsd,14,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,. in preparation and to calm some nerves i smoked a bowl of weed a short time before ingestion . during the entirety of the trip i somehow managed to continue

9943,6_2c-d,6,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,having to vomit . the nausea comes and goes in waves for about minutes before slowly subsiding . my whole body suddenly starts to feel extremely cold like freezing even though
9944,21_lsd,21,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,laid flat on my back i really know what happened next . i think i passed out and had a kind of fever dream of a tall red figure asking me
9945,83_lsd,83,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,first in my bloodline to ever experience this kind of ecstasy but the term falls short of what i felt to be the absolute epitome of cool . i had tapped

9952,50_lsd,50,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,wanted to smoke some pot . i used the lavatory noticed my pupils were no longer dialated and returned to pack up a bong . we smoked about grams of pot
9953,47_2c-d,47,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,an hour after the injection the visuals die down . light psychedelia to hours and shortly thereafter i return to baseline with the exception of a lingering sensation not unlike haven
9954,27_lsd,27,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,and experiences i was actually crying for an hour my boyfriend was keeping track of time when i got back i still could talk and i was experiencing mild hallucinations those
9955,41_2c-d,41,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,at the mirror my eyes were noticeably dilated outside they were not . after a short bout of rather soft stool i headed out feeling much better than before . my

9959,43_lsd,43,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,notice something quite striking for the past thirty seconds or so there has been a steady stream of people wearing black clothing passing before my eyes . as soon as i
9960,1_2c-d,1,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,mild but unmistakeable ' feeling was building . soon after this i noticed my heart rate had increased by perhaps . at this point i was unsure if it was just
9961,61_lsd,61,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,that idea recalling the strange undefinable taste the tainted PERSON left in my tea . time passed anxiously with no signs of what was to come . i took off my
9962,117_lsd,117,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,had decided that they all knew there was something wrong with me . i could pass it off as being drunk tho and that not that bad for on a DATE
9963,19_lsd,19,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,have probably started wigging out too . i could sleep for about hours from the time i took the now you would think that we learned our lesson about experimenting with

9966,2_2c-e,2,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,weird . sound would be fully disordered . i hear the melodies in the air slower . the trance beat slower . as you know i was in a psytrance festival
9967,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,asleep . i slept next hours or so only occasionally waking up to eat a quick conclusion final thoughts as a first heavy psychedelic experience it was a very nice one
9968,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,LOC LOC LOC . it was very emotional and pretty . the sound was still slow and it went on it own ways but it was starting to go down .
9969,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,hours i could still see visual disordions and hear sound a bit differently but was slowly going away . i had an awesome walk to a turnip mustard field sun was
9970,1_lsd,1,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,were also moments of lucidity reflection and clear articulation . throughout DATE DATE my pulse rate increased and decreased unpredictably in fluctuating cycles . one of the most distinctive and constant
9971,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,was just swirling and turning into fractals and spirals it made me dizzy . a quick visit to the big tent of friends back out to another forest stroll a loosely
9972,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,with my own thoughts and believes a feeling that still persists . i spent really long time in the forest sitting and watching . eventually i walked on and bumbed to
9973,-1_2c-e,-1,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,of lights going on and colors were brighter and somehow socially obnoxious first sound disordions time started to be really hard to follow by now . i think it had been
9974,42_lsd,42,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,nice blanket on the bed because what with feeling for what felt like a literal eternity that i was lost in another world i was a bit shaken and felt subliminally
9975,54_lsd,54,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,upon the world around us . i was unsettled by this thought because it was quickly accompanied by a GPE to its yin which was a thought that said what if
9976,4_2c-d,4,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,there i probably would have called . maybe or hours in my bf finally started slowly coming back to us . he could answer short easy questions though he would continue
9977,14_2c-d,14,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,some cannabis to pm just took a balloon of nitrous oxide and the experience was short but very intense . i know the enhanced the effects of the gas however as

9979,14_lsd,14,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,frequent basis but my trips were becoming wilder . i went to parties all night long taking everything to the limit . in addition to smoking pot i know had tried
9980,58_lsd,58,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,my professors were simply not simpathetic to somebody who never came to i around the clock doing projects and work almost in a cumpulsive manner . i could do it .
9981,2_2c-e,2,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,. especially much hypnoglow motion sound and sensory system strongly affected melting of sound extremely slowing down sounding more repeative than it a GPE of an ego death a point wherein

9983,44_lsd,44,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,i popped it in my mouth without thinking . about twenty minutes later we were passing a bowl of some of the best hydro i have ever seen on the balcony
9984,14_lsd,14,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,of these things if i just took the right drug in the right place and time . i tried cannabis dozens of times sometimes wisely and respectfully sometimes irresponsibly with serious

9986,41_lsd,41,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,hand and having it look into the mirror as well . i let out a short burst of laughter we looked like quite the pair of stoners . my pupils were
9987,41_lsd,41,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,like quite the pair of stoners . my pupils were so dilated i could no longer see my irises . my eyes were like my stuffed black orbs on a white

9989,33_lsd,33,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,space leaving a lot of room for energy and small amounts of neutral matter to pass right through us . my boyfriend and i smoked a bowl and then sat around
9990,10_2c-d,10,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,settled completely and i could drink what i want without any i know exactly how long this peak lasted since i spent the whole placeholder in my room either laying in
9991,28_lsd,28,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,so i ate one of the tablets and nothing seemed to happen for a very long time . i ended up going for a walk with one of the neighbourhood girls
9992,24_2c-d,24,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,was constantly laughing at witty jokes and relatability . this optimistic mood persisted for so long that i actually spent the whole night staying up and chilling in my room .
9993,22_lsd,22,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,purest mdma had ever provided . we also teared up because of the extreme pupil dilation . that state could better be described by moving and dancing than words . that
9994,43_lsd,43,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,and i am suddenly absorbed in what i swore was everything i saw moved in slow motion and all light appeared to be pixellized . this is where the missing moment
9995,39_2c-d,39,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,area . it was DATE and the flowers had all just bloomed . we walked slowly for about minutes and we started to think the colors were all brighter and that
9996,1_2c-d,1,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,this placeholder but the effect on bp was worrisome . i noticed i was breathing slow shallow breaths and felt some chest pressure but nothing like any sort of the seemed
9997,1_2c-d,1,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,awareness that something psychotropic was happening . what was more worrisome however was my heart rate and blood pressure . bp climbed to then up to nearly systolic . heart rate
9998,1_2c-d,1,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,larger rail would be much more to the first thing i noticed was my heart rate increasing to around bpm over several minutes . over about half an hour i felt
9999,7_2c-d,7,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE on mg in a gelcap with my girlfriend of over a year we were long distance during DATE DATE DATE but it was DATE DATE now and our relationship while
10000,106_lsd,106,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,the top of her the rest of the peak is hard to remember . we slowly picked up the pieces of our shattered egos and started to remember ourselves again .
10001,35_2c-d,35,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,oral dose . iv was interesting but only in the sense of feeling such a rapid flush of a phenethylamine wave come and go . the duration was too short and
10002,41_2c-d,41,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,in public settings depending on how sensitive one is of course . very minor pupil dilation as well which makes it nice for being out in public . though there is
10003,95_lsd,95,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i just kept repeating how rather die than be out in the open any longer and slowly this statement turned from hyperbole to an actual thought . once i realized
10004,61_2c-d,61,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,tea over the course of an hour or two can provide a much smoother comeup time with little to no rush . a slight phenethylamine is apparent during rectal and oral
10005,58_lsd,58,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,dulled and blurred my sensory perception . i left the class wishing it had been longer than an hour and a half . my consciousness digested the lecture and experience as
10006,48_2c-d,48,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,in that sense in that it very much allows the user to have good energy fast mental capacity and a general feeling of . where it differs from cocaine is that
10007,10_2c-d,10,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,though sure the alcohol had a part in that . it also lasted a notably longer than the trip . even more so than my experience with it was apparent that
10008,5_2c-d,5,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,at the clock all night and writing a trip report was an afterthought . very slow ride up very pleasant all around . a companion and i both likened it to
10009,14_lsd,14,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,portion of the beginning that i was getting worried that we would run out of time . that the drug would end too fast . i was used to having weed
10010,19_lsd,19,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,not ruin our sleep schedule . it was overall an amazing experience that felt so long and intense . each thing felt like different sections of time and eventually felt like
10011,68_lsd,68,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,grand realizations . a pattern started to arise in my statements when ' all of time and i mean infinity every phenomenon that has happened or will ever happen was happening
10012,20_lsd,20,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,a hit then offers me one to which i accept . taking three or four long hits each my body felt a familiar warmth from the bud along with my swooning
10013,47_lsd,47,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,not expect that it will ever leave though it may become partially obscured by the slow return of my normal cycles of over by the counter where people are talking animatedly
10014,55_lsd,55,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,dysphoria during a trip is something i wanted to avoid at all costs so i quickly looked away and tried to move on to something else . however i was drawn
10015,43_lsd,43,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,i focused hard enough suddenly my peripheral vision was much clearer colors started changing really rapidly and it felt like i was being sucked into something . it was very bizarre
10016,24_2c-d,24,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,the interrupted each other during conversation stared at their ORG devices for unbelievable amounts of time and played terrible music that grated my ears i was in a state of emotional
10017,51_lsd,51,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,more than i could from my dmt the path was not visual or spacial or temporal it was total immersion across all my senses and then some more . i felt
10018,50_lsd,50,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,to risk getting caught like that so i stayed back for a it did take long to get antsy i packed myself up my bong and everything i needed to go
10019,10_2c-d,10,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,some random things especially talking to the cashier at the gas soon after this placeholder period i was what felt like completely sober the feeling of being high had left my
10020,14_lsd,14,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,it it was bound to happen to now made the decision that i will no longer touch any sort of hallucinogens or marijuana . i just wish everyone else who was
10021,13_2c-d,13,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,great although i do not feel more refreshed than keep in mind that the above timeline is very rough as i did not take notes during the i can say this
10022,35_lsd,35,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,the screen i read a post that i previously read before dosing saying been a long time coming . you know what to like exactly what i had been thinking .
10023,23_lsd,23,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,our smoke friends . throughout all this i was tripping but in soon it came time to take ash home . the trip was good but we both agreed it was
10024,58_lsd,58,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,these decisions . a failure i was as if all the classes that i have passed were coming back to haunt me all at once . serves me right i during
10025,5_2c-d,5,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,it seems like i had grown bored of the trip . at this point of time i was still tripping a little bit but was coming down slowly . my friends
10026,58_lsd,58,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,static and my hands disappointingly familiar . the opportunity was not ideal after all and time has taken its toll on the teacher whose lessons i had been putting off .
10027,49_lsd,49,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,because we all had taken shrooms before and sort of ugly because i saw faces slowly distorting . we went to some field and sat down on the ground and then
10028,14_2c-d,14,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,galvanic and dynamic machine . we smoke a great deal of cannabis and the trip quickly fades away below and beyond my notice into just being conclusion there were two noteworthy
10029,16_2c-d,16,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,feeling i tend to get as psychedelics wear rather it feels like my brain is slowly and gently being warmed up elevated into a more functional state . not that sense
10030,5_2c-d,5,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,of wine taken with good food and good friends i apologize for the lack of timeline but i honestly look at the clock all night and writing a trip report was
10031,18_2c-d,18,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,snorting the chemical was more so than other dosed intranasally . the second was how short it it was fast intense pretty uncomfortable but passed into nothing fairly quickly . overall
10032,6_2c-d,6,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,. however i still feel fairly sniffly and uncomfortable the twisting nausea has not yet passed and i am shivering and shaking a good bit with deep chills running the length
10033,6_2c-d,6,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,sickness in my guts . i want to vomit but the feeling is manageable so long as i lie on my back . any movement dares to disturb this equilibrium .
10034,19_lsd,19,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,i just want this lingering feeling to end ' . the experienced had seemed to pass very quickly and it was obvious to cannon wreck ashe and i that sleep was

10036,78_2c-d,78,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,most interesting thing of this trip the importance of numbers in my effects are now slowly wearing off i enjoy watching scrubs and looking at the morphing faces of the actors
10037,35_lsd,35,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,take a smaller dosage . but i have never regretted my experience sorry about the length i hope this will be of use to some people interested in the acid experience
10038,35_lsd,35,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,of people but my first dose had been about a micrograms and i had been slowly working up to about micrograms . i never had any really bad experiences and i
10039,49_lsd,49,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,places to sit down and relax . so we popped one blot each around afternoon time . sandy has many experiences with shrooms and one placeholder with ORG . but the
10040,12_lsd,12,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,i also developed anxiety problems . i not sure what changed but i can no longer handle acid anymore and i kind of sad about that but well there always mushrooms
10041,24_2c-d,24,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,everything and laughing about things no one sober would find remotely funny . of the time approximately i was talking on the phone with the girl i mentioned . still peaking
10042,64_lsd,64,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,any obstacles or problems that come to me are very easy to energy i no longer require chemicals to forcibly raise my energy . unlike caffeine i am able to call
10043,5_2c-d,5,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,friends about this from this moment on they made fun of me from placeholder to time which is not in any way enjoyable while tripping . effects are getting stronger every
10044,64_2c-d,64,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,having drunk too much coffee but without the head rush . my heartbeat is mildly accelerated and my breathing is a bit short . nothing too strong but a bit uncomfortable
10045,55_2c-d,55,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,PERSON vanishes . i spend some placeholder surfing the internet . i have a very short burst of euphoria but nothing strong . i feel a bit like having taken a
10046,47_lsd,47,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,hoping we meet alice and her companions down below . the effects kicked in much faster than either my friend or i were expecting . in about minutes we both felt
10047,6_2c-d,6,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,stomach discomfort lasts the whole placeholder of the experiment . after hours i eaten a quick snack and it fixed my stomach for minutes . having had no adverse except for
10048,6_lsd,6,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,in the room while the rest of us were tripping heavily . luckily the nausea passed . for about twenty minutes i felt very little effects . i was already stoned
10049,19_lsd,19,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,at this point we all decided to try out sleep . it had been a long tremulous eventful evening . i have never slept harder in my life . when we
10050,55_lsd,55,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,i started to feel something . my hands and feet got sweaty and my excitement quickly morphed into euphoria . another minutes later colors became more vibrant and had a mild
10051,2_2c-d,2,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,touch the came on . for those of you who heard the song take a quick break and listen to it . obviously not the most positive song to listen to
10052,6_lsd,6,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,though it was going to swallow me up . finally after what seemed like an eternity we got up and started to walk back to my friend house . as we
10053,22_lsd,22,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,with some extra pattern recognition and vision distortion . it nearly resembled a strange mdma speedy experience . i enjoyed some of the visual aspects but i got stuck in some
10054,7_2c-d,7,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,one engraving marked as being from DATE DATE ad . these engraved words by people long forgotten the only goodbye their ghostly longing had been able to push through to this
10055,6_lsd,6,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,trying to stop myself from drawing attention as people look at me . i walked faster and entered my house . my stomach felt acidic and hurt a bit so i
10056,8_2c-d,8,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,got there we realized that even though we were coming down it was happening veeeeery slowly . we could feel that drug subsiding but the effects stayed just as strong and
10057,56_lsd,56,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE . i was taking it times DATE DATE in small dosages and having the time of my life . everything from working to social interaction to alone time was a
10058,44_lsd,44,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,on let say molecular level . i take a bite of something and like in slow motion i can feel single nerves from my tongue hitting by brain and creating flavor
10059,33_lsd,33,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,bowl using a fork . it seemed as if each frame of motion lasted seconds longer than it was supposed unable to process what was going on in the real world
10060,14_2c-d,14,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,plus several hits of cannabis and a couple dozen whippets and again had a fabulous time which he said seemed to be pretty much in line with published reports on and
10061,12_lsd,12,lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,taking perscrition or over the counter medicines and substances . i have only had a passing thought of taking organic mushrooms because my thought was that maybe i could replace the
10062,27_mdma,27,mdma,Entactogens,disease . with my lip looking worse than before but not at the second swelling time i went home and finally passed out . i still to DATE DATE have hallucinations
10063,17_mdma,17,mdma,Entactogens,sure crank has its pluses but that does always make up for its minuses . long term problems are worth a short period of fun . if you bent on trying
10064,31_2c-b,31,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,plateau until hour then a very precipitous return to nearly straight . there is a long tail to the trip we were fully down after hours total . effects mood changes
10065,13_mdma,13,mdma,Entactogens,this its not a singular as it seems to be for me . i rolled time in my life once DATE DATE DATE DATE and once DATE DATE DATE . the
10066,51_mdma,51,mdma,Entactogens,dmt except that i was compelled to quest for something . the quest lasted a short amount of time but was very difficult . when i reached the top of a
10067,58_mdma,58,mdma,Entactogens,work . i never in my life have been able to do my job that fast and normally i hate cleaning and that night i cleaned everything from the drains in
10068,31_2c-b,31,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,during my most recent trip i took . the height of the peak lasted a short time but was unbelievably intense . i was watching the anime movie neighbor and i
10069,9_mdma,9,mdma,Entactogens,living room became a living rainbow . all the color were so vivid and the longer in stayed wrapped in my blanket the harder i would trip . never felt so
10070,47_2c-b,47,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,depending on the nature of the psychological contents released might well choose to stay open longer than anticipated . although there has been reference to a physical energy surge there is
10071,30_mdma,30,mdma,Entactogens,me that the acid he had taken was stronger than he thought and from the time he was in the car with us he was feeling evil presences evil all around
10072,40_2c-b,40,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,. mostly general conversation to keep me occupied until my friend showed up . as time ticked by and he popped up online yet i became more nervous . what if
10073,24_mdma,24,mdma,Entactogens,' i want to get a job to buy e everyday ' hehe i agreed quickly and grinned . anyway next we retired to our chairs and to music . but
10074,36_mdma,36,mdma,Entactogens,eat about once a week maybe . it became about a everyday thing it no longer seemed like a big deal and since my good friend was dealing i was eatting
10075,85_2c-b,85,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,. at some point i painstakingly logged back into irc and even that took a long time due to inability to move my hands well though i could slowly type with
10076,59_mdma,59,mdma,Entactogens,would itch like crazy where the needle went in and i covered my arms with long sleeves or makeup to hide the bruising . i now weigh lbs when i quit
10077,28_2c-b,28,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,important for the trip . throughout the experience we spent a large amount of our time on our we headed back to a house . there we swallow a single pill
10078,21_mdma,21,mdma,Entactogens,a very powerful dream . we sat on the couch for the rest of the time not speaking much hardly believing what had just happened . it all felt so unreal
10079,101_mdma,101,mdma,Entactogens,gram a day . this amount got me good and rocked each day all day long . my girlfriend liked to do speed but never had any money and i was
10080,38_mdma,38,mdma,Entactogens,of ORG or just stay up so many days in a row that i would pass out due to how exausted and sleep deprived i really thought i was not as
10081,26_mdma,26,mdma,Entactogens,hyperactive minds like mine and it allowed me to think very clearly and not so quick on the i began to throw up later in the evening and PERSON like the
10082,9_mdma,9,mdma,Entactogens,apparently a giant GPE GPE ball it was swept gently by the breeze into view slowly driting perpendicular across my field of vision and reflecting the sunlight into a thousand directions
10083,44_2c-c,44,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,but no this tasted much worse . i gagged a bit at the flavor but quickly employed my can of soda which killed the bad rolled around quickly and r had
10084,11_2c-c,11,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,typing to friends had seemed to become my whole world . i looked at the clock and noticed it was a bit after am . minutes have gone without me realizing
10085,30_mdma,30,mdma,Entactogens,did acid a few times and shied from it because i did care for the length of the trip . i just liked the laughing and colors that became so intense
10086,3_2c-c,3,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,the visual aspect at that point as then i was enjoying speaking to some placeholder passed and suddenly i felt a bit aroused . why i do not know . out
10087,63_mdma,63,mdma,Entactogens,be rubbed . to me it felt like a really cool version of adderall except shorter lived and more psychadelic . this is why i think i might have gotten ORG
10088,101_mdma,101,mdma,Entactogens,some batches are very strong and a tiny amount gets me super high for a long time whereas some batches are cut badly and i need a half gram to get
10089,27_mdma,27,mdma,Entactogens,work for the next two still thinking this is all a hallucination and i was slowly dying i recovered the best i could i saw the world differently just things here
10090,47_mdma,47,mdma,Entactogens,. i had PERSON this really was so bad . the effects were a lot quicker i am now about minutes into the experience and it feels more like edging toward
10091,27_mdma,27,mdma,Entactogens,dissolution sensations bright and intense urge to hug and kiss people appetite loss visual distortion rapid involuntary eye jiggling nystagmus somewhat mild visual hallucinations uncommon moderately increased heart rate and blood
10092,11_mdma,11,mdma,Entactogens,what seemed like minutes had been four hours . i had completely lost track of time . however the relief that i felt when i knew i had survived was amazing
10093,101_mdma,101,mdma,Entactogens,call to my dealer whom occasionally messed with crystal . i knew it was a long shot but when he answered and told me he could bring the quarter gram to
10094,20_mdma,20,mdma,Entactogens,hitting it . i feel nothing so far . maybe a slight increase in heart rate but nothing to write home about . i take multiple hits in a row off
10095,33_mdma,33,mdma,Entactogens,i knew exactly what he meant . i get ready as b lights and begins slowly rotating the bowl back and forth . i take my first draw blow it out
10096,63_mdma,63,mdma,Entactogens,more eventful in my eyes though they do not compare and adderall definitely stays around longer . i honestly do see the pull . i honestly do see the pull .
10097,72_2c-c,72,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,over the user . does not produce the true ego death that ORG provides . long term memory reflections and introspection were definitely major features of the experience but i doubt
10098,47_mdma,47,mdma,Entactogens,self the effects lasted for about hours with a peak after . there was also time distortion i am missing about hours although not a memory blank more likely my perception
10099,53_mdma,53,mdma,Entactogens,boredom every placeholder i ran out of things to do i hit the pipe to pass time . soon it started to get expensive so would buy a gram sell half
10100,39_mdma,39,mdma,Entactogens,there was a beautiful fountain in the embankment of this park with lights under the rapidly running water . this took place in DATE DATE so everything was still newly green
10101,32_mdma,32,mdma,Entactogens,hand i comfortably sat on a chair outside atempting to ready myself . after a long prior bad lsd trip where i went catatonic for hours i occasionaly suffer from '
10102,26_mdma,26,mdma,Entactogens,. thoughts flowed through my head a mile a second and i could not talk fast enough or stop dancing . since that night however i have rolled more times and
10103,15_mdma,15,mdma,Entactogens,am i always here why am i here now intellectually it makes no sense . time is undefined it is purely a learned concept . everything the rest of the events
10104,66_2c-b,66,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,wrong . throughout the night i would go through spurts of nausea and then even shorter periods of a very strong but pleasant buzz throughout my body . i could see
10105,13_2c-b,13,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,can not expect to predict such an event it is better to allow the additional time in advance . the reverse has often happened and is equally unpredictable . there are
10106,24_mdma,24,mdma,Entactogens,we had never had the courage to bring up laughing crying some holding eachother tight passing through gift shops and record stores attempting to make easter eggs they came out pretty
10107,12_mdma,12,mdma,Entactogens,and grams of psilocybe cubensis mushrooms . at one point i remember turning to my clock on my nightstand it grew arms and legs and was just dancing slowly and smoothly
10108,55_2c-c,55,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,once this process of waves of mild euphoria coming and going continued for the whole length of the trip and was the only interesting feature . neither of us experienced any
10109,69_mdma,69,mdma,Entactogens,but why would i want to do that that my story i sorry it was long but it means so much to me . ill try and correct all the grammar
10110,60_mdma,60,mdma,Entactogens,. sniff nah that was enough maybe a little more sniff there we go shower time . minutes later who talking do you hear that too i turned the tv off
10111,60_mdma,60,mdma,Entactogens,overwhelming orgasms had completely made me forget about my wife so i ran the shower quickly and rinsed off consciously amazingly . the warm water was great but i was able
10112,86_mdma,86,mdma,Entactogens,like a transparent am i think i got up to take over pisses over this period of time anyways i am sipping on a bottle of water cause i felt like
10113,80_mdma,80,mdma,Entactogens,have talked alot . i was full of energy i started doing my art work faster and better . i soon abandoned my work to further explore this substance . for
10114,53_mdma,53,mdma,Entactogens,hit the pipe . mostly i would pay for my sacks but some of the time it would be free . but now i am paying for all of that '
10115,43_mephedrone,43,mephedrone,Entactogens,after maybe seconds to a minute my eyes started darting back and forth very very quickly to the point that i could actually see anything . that lasted about thirty minutes
10116,55_mephedrone,55,mephedrone,Entactogens,to me . i really enjoyed the eye darting which was accompanied by a very speedy mind and continued intense after the initial stimulant rush i was just pleasantly euphoric stimulated
10117,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,like when you get chloriney water up your nose in the swimming pool . it quickly started going to the back of my throat and i can feel something trickling down
10118,1_mephedrone,1,mephedrone,Entactogens,. i think maybe the noradrenaline has been released first i can feel my heart rate increasing it thumping quite a bit harder and i sweating . i start jittering and
10119,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,surge of dopamine is washing all over me and it does nt reach plateau any time soon it carries on going up and i feel like i want to scream in
10120,18_mephedrone,18,mephedrone,Entactogens,a research chemical so i snorted half at first and waited about minutes . i quickly felt it onset and i bumped the other half . i was high off my
10121,8_mephedrone,8,mephedrone,Entactogens,drug but i knew in the back of my mind that i was close to passing out or dying . however i truly care . i was on cloud and death
10122,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,of my experience was similar to what i previously described . my ocd was no longer a factor . i feel like performing any compulsions and things were simple for the
10123,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,absorbing the things around i was starting to come down . my eyes were no longer shaking but i was still upbeat . i was slightly less euphoric but still happy
10124,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,heading to a friends house to meet up with some other friends as well . fast forward to about iv smoked about worth of some pretty good weed and had a
10125,-1_mephedrone,-1,mephedrone,Entactogens,to have all kicked in after about ORG the first thing i noticed was the rapid heart and then a kind of flushing feeling on and around my face and body
10126,85_mephedrone,85,mephedrone,Entactogens,could nt type at all because of how fast i was trying to make myself fast forward again to i got dared by a friend over msn i call him n
10127,40_mephedrone,40,mephedrone,Entactogens,talkative with all of my friends . we all seem to have such an easy time understanding one another . we having an awesome time helping my friends clean up their
10128,7_mephedrone,7,mephedrone,Entactogens,awesome time helping my friends clean up their house and listening to music but are quickly distracted from everything cool for DATE DATE DATE DATE DATE until we redose . i
10129,17_mephedrone,17,mephedrone,Entactogens,and set a limit before pros energy overclocks the sex increases to feels like a speedy roll but shorter increase in tactile cons uniary retention some does mix well with other
10130,2_mephedrone,2,mephedrone,Entactogens,onto another motion feels excellent sic they were ones and i remember doing this deliberately slowed functional impairment trying to plug speakers in placeholder of breath heart racing everything is awesome
10131,22_mephedrone,22,mephedrone,Entactogens,control i could feel my breathing nor my heart beating for some placeholder wiggles much faster than with mdma subsiding feel a little song constantly the long no idea just brushed
10132,85_mephedrone,85,mephedrone,Entactogens,website chatbox in my life still racing at this point i turned on metronomy heart rate rapid writing for a little while to brush my hair lol reading discussions is very
10133,23_mephedrone,23,mephedrone,Entactogens,this point nicotine gum but really craving cig now i guess i did remember how long i had it in pretty okay i left the music off for some for a
10134,3_mephedrone,3,mephedrone,Entactogens,each placeholder i knew i was going to throw up again but it was painfully slow to come . the first placeholder it happened i opened my eyes and there was
10135,2_mephedrone,2,mephedrone,Entactogens,. i felt a passion for music but did want to listen to it . time passed by extremely fast as it was already . i felt pretty drained of physical
10136,50_2c-b,50,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,passed to me i proceeded to take a bong hit and hold it while i passed it to my friend . i held it in longer then my friend who smokes
10137,1_mephedrone,1,mephedrone,Entactogens,my chest was still hurting and my heart was still being forced to beat too fast but i trusted i would be the next morning and my chest still feels uncomfortable
10138,44_mephedrone,44,mephedrone,Entactogens,sort of a sweet . a peppermint completely masked the taste of the t tachycardia rate around while hrs post oral dose minutes post PERSON redose starting to feel it .
10139,1_mephedrone,1,mephedrone,Entactogens,m talking to my fiance who in the room . writing a list . heart rate still elevated . kind of like mdpv without the edge stimulated but not wired or
10140,18_mephedrone,18,mephedrone,Entactogens,hard to sit still and focus so maybe not . next placeholder will either wait longer before redosing or start by snorting avoids waiting for the onset and redosing too soon
10141,10_mephedrone,10,mephedrone,Entactogens,stimulant effects block some of the alcohol depressant effects allowing me to drink large volumes quickly . this will result in a nasty nauseating hangover that is best avoided . however
10142,102_mephedrone,102,mephedrone,Entactogens,experiences had been deeply pleasurable entirely in line with descriptions of feelings elsewhere it had slowly and almost imperceptibly become more like regular amphetamine . assuming my supplier had maintained fairly
10143,5_mephedrone,5,mephedrone,Entactogens,trip and if a trip got particularly heavy then nothing more than remembering that will pass ' is sufficient to get me through . but i found myself repeating that quite
10144,7_mephedrone,7,mephedrone,Entactogens,heavy and all broadly enjoyable and perhaps even a bit DATE morning kicked in with lengthy train rides for us all back home and i did reach home until DATE DATE
10145,37_mephedrone,37,mephedrone,Entactogens,unusually low for me . regardless of what i been up to or for how long i can generally count on being well on the way back to normal the morning
10146,7_mephedrone,7,mephedrone,Entactogens,pretty close listless shaky beginning to panic about work DATE DATE DATE hence the will pass ' and a tongue still on fire with which i could barely speak . i
10147,47_mephedrone,47,mephedrone,Entactogens,this was still ok or verging onto dangerous . i had heard the effects were short lived lasting only and hour or two . however an hour later i was still
10148,50_2c-b,50,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,everyone was having fun . i had brought my bong with me and it was passed to me with a kb hit packed ready to go . i could already feel
10149,17_mephedrone,17,mephedrone,Entactogens,occasionally skip or a small segment would repeat itself or it seemed like it would slow down and just lose part of the beat and then skip ahead a few seconds
10150,7_mephedrone,7,mephedrone,Entactogens,i had a really bad headache felt really distant and could think clearly . my short term memory was definitely messed up . over DATE DATE DATE DATE i noticed i
10151,55_mephedrone,55,mephedrone,Entactogens,our walk back that the perception of social context killed our euphoria . however it swiftly returned with a nice walk and we headed to the pharmacy to purchase some condoms
10152,28_2c-b,28,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,one i know have tried anyway i just swallow the pill and wrote down the time just before this have i eaten a big meal food . at about so did
10153,69_mephedrone,69,mephedrone,Entactogens,dose . to explain further on the book next to me the letters were changing rapidly in place as if a manic copywriter were overwriting all of the letters randomly and
10154,26_mephedrone,26,mephedrone,Entactogens,few sentences over and over . this is not unlike psychosis but it was with longer thoughts instead of fragments . there were physical effects too the world started to look
10155,18_mephedrone,18,mephedrone,Entactogens,the after most of the teachers and parents had left the prom at about o clock we started to snort . i tell you a bit about how lower doses of
10156,26_mephedrone,26,mephedrone,Entactogens,and have the urge to move my body . my thinking is absolutely clear and fast or that s at least how i perceive it . my body feels relaxed and
10157,109_mephedrone,109,mephedrone,Entactogens,that if we all were silent for only like seconds or if someone said a long interlaced sentence we people would collectively just forgot what we were talking about and this
10158,18_mephedrone,18,mephedrone,Entactogens,hard cravings made me snort far too big lines but the others were going pretty fast as well . and if you accidentally put a little more on the table you
10159,77_2c-b,77,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,my voice . i felt natural and primal no need for makeup fashion norms no time for judging paranoia ungratefulness or fear . no matter how much our faces were covered
10160,10_mephedrone,10,mephedrone,Entactogens,do or would have wanted to do . when we left the house at o clock i thought i was already quite sober . the cab drive home taught me otherwise
10161,22_mephedrone,22,mephedrone,Entactogens,slightly stimulating which i want and the empathy which sounds great as this has been slowly dwindling with mdma over DATE DATE stomach empty . nothing eaten in prior drug use
10162,22_mephedrone,22,mephedrone,Entactogens,like i had a good dose of proper good quality mdma although i typing stupidly fast . my brain is racing . i feel like i so energized . i feel
10163,34_2c-b,34,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,made a decision to go on a bit of a stop using everything for a period of time which i did not even cannabis for DATE DATE DATE and a bit
10164,8_mephedrone,8,mephedrone,Entactogens,much hours hours is what i found . stimulants such as cocaine hit me very quickly when but end up in a crash within minutes . this is definately not the
10165,21_mephedrone,21,mephedrone,Entactogens,do really remember this . was it all a dream this hour went by so fast . holy shit . i still feel good though as a euphoria of some sort
10166,2_mephedrone,2,mephedrone,Entactogens,good and i was happy to listen to anything without vocals . my heart beat rate was i had a feeling that i still have a breakthrough with this chemical and
10167,18_mephedrone,18,mephedrone,Entactogens,over the tongue . boom after snorting the line we all feel it . clear speedy like shifting up a gear it comes on strong . writing is easy and concentration

10442,24_mdma,24,mdma,Entactogens,. then we made a stop at a cement wall . we ran our hands slowly down the wall laughing almost crying at how weird it felt how amazing it felt
10443,30_mdma,30,mdma,Entactogens,i just wanted to sleep it away and honestly at one point when i was slowly getting to somewhat drift off the acid reflux would hit me and be in crazy
10444,71_mdma,71,mdma,Entactogens,his feet steer his bottom half . needless to say any feeling i had was quickly dissolved by these practical concerns . i was stone cold sober hoping that he was
10445,10_2c-c,10,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,no hangover no body ache no headache nothing . this could be attributed to the short duration and mild effect of the overall it was a very mild experience . none

10465,50_mdma,50,mdma,Entactogens,apparatus was different . well it looked like a bong you know . so we passed that back and forth . we each took about five nice rips off of it

11379,10_1p-lsd,10,1p-lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,with them at all . visuals are back to normal and my mind is no longer going anywhere out of the ordinary . so we drink play PERSON PERSON and generally
11380,21_valeriana officinalis,21,valeriana officinalis,Depressant / sedatives,even on the side there no way that my buddy could have gotten away that fast . i heard the voice first in my dream and then once i had woken

11393,14_turnera diffusa,14,turnera diffusa,Depressant / sedatives,the best part about it all though was that i felt the relaxation without the rapid heartbeat or panicky feeling in the back of my mind that weed would give me
11394,50_turnera diffusa,50,turnera diffusa,Depressant / sedatives,nervousness but due to the rigours of everyday life myself and my partner required a quicker hit of this so i decided to use a bong aka waterpipe previously having consulted
11395,21_turnera diffusa,21,turnera diffusa,Depressant / sedatives,and feeling overpowered again i somehow got myself to bed to fall asleep for a longer dreams were filled with longing childhood crushes teetering romantic advances . it was extremely vivid

11398,9_1p-lsd,9,1p-lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,the normal light green background was changing all sorts of colours a bit like a slow christmas lights sequence . i did even bother to try reading anything as the words
11399,66_salvia divinorum,66,salvia divinorum,Other,being sucked by a huge vacuum or something . very weird but all this weirdness passed in about minutes . my buzz lasted for another minutes or so but it was
11400,38_salvia divinorum,38,salvia divinorum,Other,of ORG heads as if a whole other room was below . the people were slowly walking very close together shoulder touching . this really freaked me out and i guess
11401,49_salvia divinorum,49,salvia divinorum,Other,this had lasted no more than minutes but wherever i had been there was no time . by this point it felt like the comedown from shrooms brain a little mushy
11402,70_salvia divinorum,70,salvia divinorum,Other,what if someone sees me on drugs and calls the cops this paranoid impracticality was quickly suppressed by the everyday logic that there is nothing about a shirtless man leaning on

12627,64_2c-i,64,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,a very nervous person and my anxiety is coming back which feels like being sober time feels back to normal . drinking half caffeinated coffee . i trust myself walking down
12628,31_argyreia nervosa,31,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,very positive . i am a giant fan . i would further say that the period of time between hours before and after the peak for hours total is probably a
12629,52_argyreia nervosa,52,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,knowledge all catalyzed by the mind opening powers of seeds . so in order to pass the placeholder and to distract our almost menacing anticipations we decided to watch a movie

12634,27_argyreia nervosa,27,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,obvious that i even need to explicitly think about it . it was during the time spent listening to music that i began to visually hallucinate to a slight degree .

12644,6_amt,6,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,hopes of relieving the nausea . after throwing up for minutes the nausea subsided rather quickly and i returned to the group . the other three who had taken the amt
12645,8_amt,8,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to say i was by the drug i realised this must have just been a slow come up . the first onset i experienced was change in body temperature i suddenly

12647,70_amt,70,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,music awesome . the visuals are greatly accentuated by smoking a few bongs and spliffs slowly from this point onwards . neither b nor me have experienced any paranoia as sometimes

12652,14_amt,14,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,marijuana before amt i now have fairly vivid visual traces at all times have a prolonged sleeping problem and stomach discomfort all accruing from the this is where everything went wrong
12653,39_amt,39,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. it leafless branches unfurled and rewound as if there were a fisheye lense moving slowly back and forth among them . the only thing i did really like about amt
12654,47_amt,47,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,nothing for five hours . i was really suprised because i was prepared for a rapid . the visuals were very mild but the stimulating effect of the substance was one
12655,3_amt,3,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,around eyeballing the room with such excitement i was still pretty awake and ready to clock off . so when the placeholder came for them to savour a bit more smoke
12656,2_amt,2,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,whole different dimension i had so much more appreciation for sound in particular PERSON PERSON time would pass and we would just lie absorbed in the music it was awesome .
12657,3_amt,3,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and after over hours of no sleep i decided it was placeholder for me to clock off and get rid of this freaky feeling . if i thought getting to the
12658,10_amt,10,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,went on for about an hour . i still sleeping . i think i was slowly starting to sober up i managed to splash my face with water have a drink
12659,1_amt,1,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was difficult to find my pulse but when i did i realized it was quite rapid . i started to believe i was dying . i tried to turn my thoughts
12660,5_amt,5,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the rest i could describe is just psychedelic babble but i can tell you the duration of the trip was about nine intense hours and four relaxing ones however DATE DATE
12661,5_amt,5,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was feeling ecstatic . there was no paranoia in the trip either . we passed by many families and simply allowed them to enjoy their own worlds while we enjoyed
12662,52_amt,52,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,just because it was so late . but i could feel the energy and somewhat speedy effects of the amt right along with my tiredness . after the movie was over
12663,31_amt,31,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,should be finishing my ascent to the top by now but still nothing more than speedy rushes and marked sensitivity maybe a couple of trails here and there . we sat
12664,8_amt,8,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,back to baseline by now i have clearly been thrown for a loop at the duration of this drug . the neighboring fraternity house across the street is melting to almost
12665,6_2c-i,6,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,old lady nausea you be not welcome here ' and laughing crazily . the nausea passed and i tried to get up out of my bed but it was very dark
12666,10_amt,10,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,brought back to cups and a pitcher of PERSON PERSON drank it all over a period of about during this two hours PERSON leaned against the car and i walked in
12667,81_amt,81,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,na have to trip on this again ' and as the story goes it was passing time between and period when my boyfriend handed me a gelcap of an estimated miligrams
12668,4_amt,4,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,but because he had no idea what was going on he ignored me after the period ended and i went to meet my boyfriend . as i walked through the crowded
12669,4_amt,4,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,told myself that he must be feeling the same way as i do . we hurried outside into some woods near our school so we could wait for another friend who
12670,54_amt,54,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,amt only to people who have considerable experience with GPE and feel prepared for a long and intense journey . nobody should ever trip on this in a dangerous or public
12671,5_amt,5,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,trip is very intense and a lot of fun but it lasts for far too long considering that placeholder goes so slowly during any trip . i realized that my consciousness
12672,19_2c-i,19,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,slight naseua and difficulty falling asleep now the story for those interested after waiting a long time to get the a friend of mine b got his we had no scales
12673,44_amt,44,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. we had our doses on some tin foil and a glass of water to quickly dissolve the bad taste . my friend almost gagged when he ate his and quickly
12674,40_amt,40,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,we went to a movie which felt like about minutes . i also remember the long conversations my friend and i had while just rolling . we could talk about one
12675,24_amt,24,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and melting into eachother while yelling in their own language . i not sure how long this continued maybe acouple minutes before a red claymation man came right up to my
12676,0_amt,0,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,first hrs i call my girlfriend i barely remember this but was told many a time about it i ask her if she thinks pretty and if she thinks i should

12678,14_amt,14,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,at work watching videos really really bored a little tired no more just pot and time to break out the amt what have i got to loose no work note last
12679,35_amt,35,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,have been a little weak . plus i read that sometimes with these substances the time you take them you not quite used to them so you may have a negative
12680,3_amt,3,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,here when the effects really start to kick in i had stopped looking at the clock at this placeholder and my sense of time was gone from here on so i
12681,28_amt,28,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,that much i have some sort of natural tollernce to no matter what even the time i ever rolled i have to take atleast pills to feel anything i do nt
12682,11_2c-i,11,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,noticed my mangled hands blending in with the kitchen counter . i looked at the clock again and it was . it had felt like an eternity had passed since i
12683,5_amt,5,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the trip was in full swing and i was having fun . i noticed how slowly time was going when examined but when looking back it went by rapidly . we
12684,7_amt,7,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i decided to make the most of DATE DATE and go with the flow . shortly after i vomited the second placeholder a and j vomited also regurgitating much of the
12685,67_amt,67,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,however unlike meth i did feel like getting up or doing anything per se . shortly thereafter pretty much when those pig noises on the woob cd kicked in i began
12686,32_amt,32,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was like a mixture of mdma methamphetamine and ORG . it certainly had an extremely long duration much like lsd but after we had come down sleeping for me was an
12687,12_amt,12,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a hard placeholder getting the right mind set for mushrooms but i specifically think the long coming down period of amt seems like a very good placeholder to do a serious
12688,3_amt,3,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,its own instead it opens wide a very unique space and gives you plenty of time to explore it figure it out and start using it however you like . the
12689,5_amt,5,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the top of the trip and likely ' dealing with the strongly annoying and extremely long coming down period . certainly take it again though want to wait some placeholder before
12690,35_amt,35,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,be wary that a higher dose would increase the nausea and lengthen the coming down period without really boosting the intensity of the peak or lengthening that portion similar to what
12691,4_amt,4,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,laundry room . i clearly saw that he had seen me and that he had hurried on . not really knowing what i was doing i started after him . this
12692,31_amt,31,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,particularly intrusive . i could find them when i wanted to but most of the time i i loved the fact that the peak lasted for such a long time and
12693,41_amt,41,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a large dose of the drug and was the oldest subject in the series . dilation of the pupils was constant averaging PERSON . over a hour period . deep tendon
12694,22_amt,22,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,as a sitter . since i had previous experiences with mdma i knew drugs are quick to effect me and their effect lasts longer on me . in my opinion girls
12695,3_amt,3,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i felt this to take only a few minutes when infact several hours have passed . at this placeholder i wished the visuals to stop and they did . as
12696,16_amt,16,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,trees dancing to some psychedelic music and all the lights flashing around me would leave long tracers and after images . i would call this substance energizing but not in any
12697,22_amt,22,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,version of mda . a much gentler stimulant not pushy and with a much greater duration . i enjoyed the long slow ramp up that was followed by hours of plateau
12698,31_amt,31,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,really really stretched out . the plateau continued smooth and unabated for many hours the long duration was nice since we were staying up all if i tried this substance again
12699,64_amt,64,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,of what was happening . i ended up brewing some coffee and drinking it very slowly i was wary of amt reported maoi effects and how it would react with the
12700,13_amt,13,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i had fasted for about hours . for this report i will use the timeline format . i always felt that those are the most helpful and enjoyable to i
12701,83_amt,83,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,that amt afffects the in such a way that your body retain water for a long time unlike ecstasy on other trips i have taken it around noon and . i
12702,16_amt,16,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,completed drawing flexibility of closure . subjects were also tested for ability to estimate varying periods of time and seconds results of study clinical with onset was slower than with psilocybin
12703,57_amt,57,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,fact that most people could only put up with him for a certain amount of time . anyway i classified him as a ' and saw him as being anything but
12704,1_amt,1,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,feel like it was pounding out of my chest . i could stay inside any longer i felt like i had so much energy just did know what to do with
12705,4_amt,4,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,down so to speak . so in walks the old shop keeper who know no longer looks like an old incapable man and no longer walks with a cane . he
12706,0_amt,0,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i guess or just not really caring . so before i was informed of the quick arrival of amt i had planned for my friends nita her fiance PERSON and her
12707,10_amt,10,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a couple of beers hoping it will help me to sleep when i decide its time . c and t are sipping PERSON PERSON but i opt as always to avoid
12708,10_amt,10,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,nt feel the beer in the slightest . finally c and i both decide its time for bed . i curl up in my sleeping bag and toss and turn for
12709,78_amt,78,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. the visuals start out pretty banal and confused but they get really pretty over time . the dreaminess is great for being alone in somewhere beautiful . and my curiousity
12710,0_2c-i,0,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,course two spirits in particular were what i encountered the night before . so i slowly asked her what she sensed about them . to my amazement she described a man
12711,41_amt,41,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,what to look for . i also noticed a slightly increased pulse and mild pupil dilation . other more subjective physical affects during this initial period included a mild frontal headache
12712,0_amt,0,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,but then realized the true answer was that all a little confused most of the time . ' she seemed to think this was a strange thing to say but i
12713,9_amt,9,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,some notes on the experience so far . while doing this i keep seeing shadows passing over the page on which i am writing shadows as if from temperature turbulence refracting
12714,106_amt,106,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,also was able to resolve categorize and move on from these memories in a very quick and efficient manner . this ability is quite remarkable and very desirable and one that
12715,1_amt,1,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,started having pot induced panic attacks i have always been intensely aware of my heart rate when on any i had talked to several people who had tried amt and heard
12716,1_amt,1,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the visuals wo nt stop . feel a little nervous that my heart is too fast and feel like i need water . i feel the lifeforce of a chipmunk coming
12717,41_amt,41,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to the bathroom . totaly tripping out and our pupils are fixed at the widest dilation nice . i wait outside for my friend and talk to a few people standing
12718,19_amt,19,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. at about we decided to crash as we were yawning quite a bit and slowly coming aftermath i slept somewhat lightly and got up at about when i heard some
12719,4_amt,4,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,he started out just giggling and hugging up on his who let him know real fast man do start getting on me . ' it was obviouse to tell he was
12720,42_amt,42,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,for a ORG . i suddenly felt too weak too fucked up to stand any longer . i sat in the passenger seat my legs hanging out to stretch and i
12721,7_amt,7,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE DATE DATE she s been stuffed away . nita pulled her out by her long brown hair and laughed at how funny she looked . PERSON PERSON and i made
12722,16_amt,16,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,ecstatic states it produces . but once a person has the message ' it is time to act on that message . prolonged continued use of psychedelics hindered my path to
12723,14_amt,14,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,marijuana high but without any confusion or mental cloudiness . the second was a very speedy excited state where i wanted to run around and play like a little kid .
12724,41_2c-i,41,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,the excess energy within my own around i noted something else unusual fairly extreme pupil dilation . this seemed odd given that the visual emotional and physical effects of the substance
12725,7_amt,7,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i really like them . DATE DATE DATE DATE DATE may be hell but the long beautiful hours afterward more than make up for in addition to the really beautiful experiences
12726,24_2c-i,24,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,most of the world problems laugh just have a great trip we notice that placeholder dilation has occurred we thought maybe min had passed it had been three hours we wind
12727,2_amt,2,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the headphones not sure who it was so i handed them back . after a short brain storm on what movie to watch we picked inception thought why not it looks
12728,66_amt,66,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,been due to the fact that whenever i due any substance my body reacts very quickly to it classical conditioning see ORG . there was a slight buzz feeling but nothing
12729,78_amt,78,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,everything was so distorted looking but there developed a very large problem i could no longer understand my tv . it was as if it was speaking spanish french and german
12730,20_amt,20,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. at about the hour and a half point i could nt hold it any longer and threw up in the garbage can . immediately after throwing up a few times
12731,28_amt,28,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i think i felt the ephedra before the amt which was slightly annoying . shortly after taking the pills my friend arrived at the house to pick me up and
12732,32_amt,32,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,makes sense which is usually not the case with lsd ecstasy or as the amt slowly wore off and i mean slowly about hours after taking it i took a lortab
12733,8_amt,8,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,knew this was the early jitters i get from most drugs before my head pops shortly after delivering the doctors new treat i was dropped off just out side of the

12736,10_amt,10,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,minds . such as alcohol leaves me with a big hangover a lot of the time i often take it to forget my problems and it can mess up my body
12737,80_amt,80,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,while and i knew then exact places to put certain marks of my pencil . shortly after that the first wave of it hit PERSON and he went up pretty high
12738,2_amt,2,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,whatever music was going it was great . so morning came PERSON was coming down fast i had stopped the intensely strong visions but still was in another plane . the
12739,11_amt,11,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i had a are you sancho i lost my frame of am somebody mentions the time looks of shock sprout up in the room . b wakes up and shortly there
12740,8_amt,8,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,breathing life into us each company that we were enjoying was enhanced tenfold it was quickly becoming unanimous that it was one of the best drugs taken and there was still
12741,2_amt,2,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,patterns within it and the visible flecks of dust sparkled and glittered as well much time was spent listening to music and doing that all still unanimous on the fact that
12742,77_amt,77,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,face warped in such a way that i looked much like my brother . having passed away you think this would be a disconcerting site quite the contrary it made me
12743,45_amt,45,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,through stages and after we established all come up properly we were still in the speedy elevated mood vivid colours stage and was having a lot of fun dancing to some

14138,6_2c-t-7,6,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,and was pleased to find that my usual nausea and stomach lightness were after a long period of indecision we wound up at a dumpy karaoke bar across the street from
14139,6_2c-t-7,6,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,of nausea but i was filled with energy tremor and everything seemed to take so long the visuals were everywhere the walls were throbbing in sync with my sinuses . nothing

14144,3_2c-t-2,3,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,beginning to think it to be impossible to have a bad placeholder on this so long as you in a fairly decent mood or higher and of a fairly stable mind
14145,34_2c-t-2,34,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE but whatever it was i feel like it rewired my brain so i no longer craved cigarettes or at least severely reduced and procrastinated the medical uses social quitting smoking

14190,26_2c-t-21,26,2c-t-21,Serotonergic psychedelics,. this was both good and bad . it was nice to have a pleasant time thinking about these things but because it lacked the urgency i felt that it was

14205,34_2c-i,34,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,the money in my wallet from DATE had no meaning to me . it no longer brought me the joy that it did the night before . after scoring the buds

14214,58_2c-i,58,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,you were young . there are these professors who claim that you should study something slowly until you understand it yet with all this arbitrary bs you have to do just

14228,-1_2c-p,-1,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,into town and got canvas and headed back . come on was pleasant but really slow . come on was pleasant but really slow . i was only feeling a little

14271,13_2c-p,13,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,a fuck . i would like to mention that i had completely lost track of time during this whole event . time dilation does exist and there will be an hour
14272,54_2c-p,54,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,until i finally came down was just a jumble of dancing getting lost in GPE short walks and generally just enjoying my placeholder with the effects . the universe often would

14281,1_2c-p,1,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,helped me remember that it was all in my head . my heart was beating fast and my friend who sat rocking back and fourth opening her mouth over and over
14282,9_2c-p,9,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,looking at the stripes on washboard and seeing them turn colors . we attributed the slow intensity rise to the food we had greedily consumed however later experiences on the same
14283,6_2c-p,6,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,a wave of nausea hit them simultaneously followed by visuals much like i seen the time before . after the fraternity brothers left we wandered the snowy streets outside saw a
14284,3_2c-p,3,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,at the party they were not them all the placeholder just a lot of the time . sometimes they would be themselves and i would try to reach out to them
14285,7_2c-p,7,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,something . by the end i was reduced to scratching concepts of the working of time and space into my wall in the my dealer had taken mg DATE DATE before
14286,24_2c-p,24,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,seemed to be hilarious . i laughed so hard that my abs hurt . as time passed it began to get much darker and colder which seriously effected my trip .

14291,78_2c-p,78,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,first it pretty close to the actual game but it becomes more surreal with each passing moment . headshots play and rewind at rapid morph and do very strange things running

14295,35_2c-p,35,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was definitely done rising hours after dosing but in the middle of a very long plateau . i reiterated do give up hope . by now most of the most
14296,1_2c-p,1,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,now most of the most toxic feeling effects were mostly gone my veins were no longer grotesquely dilated my heart beat at a much calmer pace my head did not feel
14297,22_2c-p,22,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,like it was on its last legs . my heart felt worse then any other time in my life worse then even the most serious mdma binges i gone on .

14299,81_2c-p,81,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,never know how inaccurate my scale was or if an extra mg could really have extended the length of my trip by at least double and the intensity by triple fold
14300,40_2c-p,40,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,and another girl . they were very messed up . each person stood out big time and the way i felt was unexplainable . by or i started to feel like
14301,9_2c-p,9,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,what i looked at instead only giving me general out lines of objects that were slowly lost to the beams of light that composed the visuals . the colored beams and
14302,2_2c-p,2,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,were still entertaining and i even played some guitar along to sci . this was short lived though . in the end i crawled in my bed under a blanket where
14303,22_2c-p,22,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,walking by us in a stroller responded so we decided against taking the mdma and slowly walked back home . it took us about an hour to get home and i
14304,4_2c-p,4,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,the chemicals were bunk so he went into the other room with his during the time they were away i began to feel very awkward . i felt that i was

14306,78_2c-p,78,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,visuals were still strong and as if some sort of a cosmic reward for having passed through the trial for having let go of our selves and released our clutch on
14307,31_2c-p,31,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,where i really have to devote my day to it . i like the very slow buildup . if i had been thrown into that kind of a peak quickly i

14310,16_2c-p,16,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,to other psychedelics during the peak effects the perception of the speed of passage of time and relatedly visual effects is very heavily mediated by the bodily component of the trip

14668,52_amanita muscaria,52,amanita muscaria,Dissociative psychedelics,the head and just kinda spaced out for a couple seconds about every minutes . short term memory was still pretty messed up . movie was over despite it seeming to
14669,3_amanita muscaria,3,amanita muscaria,Dissociative psychedelics,like we had only been watching for minutes . it one of those goes by slow each moment at a placeholder but overall fast ' type situations . i compare that

14672,6_amanita muscaria,6,amanita muscaria,Dissociative psychedelics,to try and vomit however all resulting expulsions were exclusively gaseous . the nausea returned slowly but before it got unbearable bob was ready to smoke some cannabis with me .
14673,1_amphetamine,1,amphetamine,Stimulants,after about hours or so of reading and typing i caught my self taking very slow deep breaths . i felt my pulse and my heart was beating very very slowly
14674,1_amphetamine,1,amphetamine,Stimulants,breaths . i felt my pulse and my heart was beating very very slowly unusually slow then there was no beating for like seconds and i began to panic knowing i

14676,-1_amphetamine,-1,amphetamine,Stimulants,night i was just focused on checking my heart and breathing and trying not to pass out or anything . it was a very scary experience . i did not sleep
14677,-1_amphetamine,-1,amphetamine,Stimulants,a gigantic pill bottle of the unused meds since her gave her vyvanse and no longer had use for the adderall . so i decided since i heard many rumors of
14678,8_amphetamine,8,amphetamine,Stimulants,to look for information after ingesting the drug . i did notice and euphoric or speedy effect like cocaine but i felt much more alert . being that all i had
14679,-1_amphetamine,-1,amphetamine,Stimulants,pill and eat half of it . then without warning bam my heart is racing faster than a fuckin race horse yesss euphoria i am loving the cocaine like feeling and
14680,48_amphetamine,48,amphetamine,Stimulants,than a fuckin race horse yesss euphoria i am loving the cocaine like feeling and pace my room embracing the feeling . about an hour or two later this is where
14681,-1_amphetamine,-1,amphetamine,Stimulants,. about an hour or two later this is where i begin losing track of time . my sister knocks on the door . she asks me . u taken any

14683,-1_amphetamine,-1,amphetamine,Stimulants,probably say that it felt even better this placeholder . i watched tv a bit longer and enjoyed the euphoria . i then got up and ate a bit of food
14684,0_amphetamine,0,amphetamine,Stimulants,looks at me and says funny i could have sworn i had more ' i quickly smooth talk her and shover her out of my room . i did nt want

14686,4_amphetamine,4,amphetamine,Stimulants,did not suspect anything and i could talk normally with him although maybe a little fast . when i got home i decided to pick up my cousin from elementary school
14687,23_amphetamine,23,amphetamine,Stimulants,no problems and smoked a few while we walked around . i was talking very fast and i felt extremely happy . i felt like i was on top of the
14688,71_2c-i,71,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,everyone else was stoned and looked tired i was speeding almost speeding ahead of present time . what the fuck i thought this all feels like it already happened i expected
14689,7_amphetamine,7,amphetamine,Stimulants,waited for the bell to ring signifying the beginning of the usual relatively boring hour long period at least what long hour is like on DATE DATE not this one however
14690,3_amphetamine,3,amphetamine,Stimulants,part is that i thought i was very insightful perhaps even brilliant during this placeholder period . often after staying up for or hours on PERSON PERSON and i would lay
14691,18_amphetamine,18,amphetamine,Stimulants,of pills while she snorted more xr mg pills now and orange this happened a long time ago and i completely recall the specifics but i have a strong general idea
14692,0_amphetamine,0,amphetamine,Stimulants,i decided to take more with her . then we would tumble back into these long and growing conversations as i tried to explain the essence of myself and i felt
14693,4_amphetamine,4,amphetamine,Stimulants,at a house one night watching tv and doing other things bored teens do to pass the placeholder . he got up and walked away and was back a few minutes
14694,7_amphetamine,7,amphetamine,Stimulants,and i wondered still to DATE DATE DATE DATE DATE why it took it so long to effect me when i had heard from others the effects come on pretty quickly
14695,3_amphetamine,3,amphetamine,Stimulants,loved every bit of it after coming to this stunning realization the bell for fourth period aka long hour because it is twice as placeholder as normal classes because it is
14696,13_amphetamine,13,amphetamine,Stimulants,long hour because it is twice as placeholder as normal classes because it is the period where everyone goes to lunch in half hour intervals then back to class again until
14697,4_amphetamine,4,amphetamine,Stimulants,me . he modestly accepted my gratitude and we left to go to our respective long hour classes . i got to my english class in record time i was nearly
14698,0_amphetamine,0,amphetamine,Stimulants,her about my day and i do think she noticed that i was talking too fast or twitching my fingers . my aunt came over and i had a really great
14699,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,also found some errors as i went first drinking was fun but only lasted a short while and i would become tired . smoking pot massively increases my ocd over time
14700,0_amphetamine,0,amphetamine,Stimulants,and i had a really great conversation with her . my thoughts were coming very fast and i was still getting pleasurable shivers every once in a while . we all
14701,16_amphetamine,16,amphetamine,Stimulants,of substance though i have used mostly psychedelics . in any case the onset was quick i found myself feeling the artificial competence and benevolence characteristic of past experiences . i
14702,0_amphetamine,0,amphetamine,Stimulants,very close to on the verge of i arrived in that class and wasted little time . i talked to her call her k and explained my intentions . needless to
14703,3_amphetamine,3,amphetamine,Stimulants,was at the same placeholder but thanks to the speed it was no as the period winded down i was becoming increasingly social . i was talking at a mile a
14704,86_amphetamine,86,amphetamine,Stimulants,bathroom to take my speed . pop in my mouth . easy . twenty minutes pass i feel thirty minutes are now past i still feel not a shred of now
14705,7_amphetamine,7,amphetamine,Stimulants,this is what normal people feel like on DATE DATE DATE . the effects are slowly winding down but the pain relief is still going pretty well . the only unpleasant

14711,6_amphetamine,6,amphetamine,Stimulants,parasites and shit etc . so i occasionally became very lightheaded and felt i could pass out at any after about hours i seemed to lose a bit of the bouncy
14712,37_amphetamine,37,amphetamine,Stimulants,of the high . i finally managed to write the paper but in no less time than it probably taken sober due to the initial delay . i did lose all
14713,7_amphetamine,7,amphetamine,Stimulants,DATE DATE and it was starting to get on my nerves now i typing as fast as i can and i still ca nt keep up with my discussed everything from
14714,7_amphetamine,7,amphetamine,Stimulants,in DATE DATE DATE . the amazing thing about all of this is that the time flew by . i would check my phone to see the time and realize that

14983,22_amt,22,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,up needing it most of the night . by the placeholder an hour and minutes passed we all felt as if we were high on mdma . we had very emapatheogenic
14984,28_amt,28,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,once one pill which disappointingly gave both my friend and i no effects whatsoever . fast forward to the time and after a failed attempt at getting hold of some shrooms
14985,52_amt,52,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,mind sober but my god it was like watching the earth from the begining of time to present day in hours . the best movie after viewing it my bro and
14986,13_amt,13,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,is we decided to dose up on amt on DATE for amt DATE . the time of take off is not quite sure probably recorded somewhere . my friend and i
14987,40_amt,40,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,or had their differences we would only see each other at school most of the time . though i thought about the consequences of trying a substance at school for the
14988,65_amt,65,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,this was a hallucination but the fear still remained . from that point on to period i was getting visuals of police officers which i knew was a hallucination . i
14989,44_amt,44,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i tasted kinda like the post nasal drip i get from methamphetamines . i quickly swallowed some water with it . i was in the bathroom at the placeholder where
14990,46_amt,46,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and my stomach was queasy . my hart also felt like it was beating extremely fast and i was shivering . i had only had a small bowl of PERSON PERSON
14991,45_amt,45,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,for me yet but the rest of the guys were beginning to start feeling quite speedy and somewhat hyped all laughing and reveling and putting some music on to dance to
14992,32_amt,32,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and creative thinking was enhanced . PERSON was the threshold for hallucination . amt takes longer to come on than lsd about hours and lasts about hours . although i stopped
14993,52_amt,52,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,forgot that i had to go back to the movie . i do remember how long i was there for but i was lucky that nobody walked into the restroom because
14994,23_amt,23,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,remember wheather i smoked or not a pleasure soo great that i never thought about time or problems . a pleasure that made my eyes seen stuffs that are not there
14995,20_amt,20,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,we did . but me and my girl friend got very sick . and the time difference was sooo different . her hit her in minutes and mine hit me and
14996,11_amt,11,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,but all the characters seemed so funny and strange . i had no idea what time meant . i would look at the clock and it would say and then i
14997,45_amt,45,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,through stages and after we established all come up properly we were still in the speedy elevated mood vivid colours stage and was having a lot of fun dancing to some
14998,77_amt,77,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,face warped in such a way that i looked much like my brother . having passed away you think this would be a disconcerting site quite the contrary it made me
14999,56_amt,56,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,right people and you likely to have a great placeholder if you sensible . the length of the drug can be an off and selling point DATE DATE DATE is needed
15000,15_amt,15,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,time stood still . the next was where i could move forward and backward through time at will . my experience was that of being in a ' superimposed on normal
15001,38_amphetamine,38,amphetamine,Stimulants,here again varying based on dosage and route of administration . i would literally read faster than i can when sober documents spreadsheets emails anything at all . my retention was
15002,46_amphetamine,46,amphetamine,Stimulants,ball of yarn i was attempting to untangle making the situation worse with rash decisions fast clicks on the computer executed with a sweating i would say that these negative periods
15003,31_amphetamine,31,amphetamine,Stimulants,i had three distinct varieties of . the first type was extremely elongated . once passed the peak intensity of DATE DATE the retreat to true baseline was painfully slow .
15004,18_amphetamine,18,amphetamine,Stimulants,wo shoot up anything and i do snort addies anymore because it does last as long and it raises my tolerance too rapidly . so i decided to go with the
15005,35_amphetamine,35,amphetamine,Stimulants,. the effect wears off at about and i start at . that means the duration of the medication effect with time release is about hours . i did not use
15006,54_amphetamine,54,amphetamine,Stimulants,off task as i could have been i was engaged in a conversation with a long time user who talked to me about the effects and about other GPE . i
15007,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,any other discussed in this section . a lot of this had to do with timeline i was smoking vaporizing and eating cannabis in the peak and periods of the amphetamine
15008,18_amt,18,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. also grabbed some so i get back to my apartment a good hour has passed . i put my nose in the books . and my theory was correct i
15009,35_amt,35,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,bad trip so i started low and i happy with my the stuff lasts quite long it now hours from the first noticeable effects and i feel mentally very clear despite
15010,12_amt,12,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and a quarter of mushrooms . i kept fading in and out of reality losing time and having difficulty in communicating with those not on the drug . i do not
15011,41_amt,41,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,first noticeable effects and i feel mentally very clear despite a tired body . eye dilation same as from or mushrooms not as bad as with if feeling a little fried
15012,34_amphetamine,34,amphetamine,Stimulants,intensity of the effects . i often would use cannabis tactically to pick up the pace when i could feel myself starting to drag or depart from DATE DATE DATE DATE
15013,52_amphetamine,52,amphetamine,Stimulants,definitely wrong . at this point things then got a little weird to say the shortly after i got back to my seat in the movie theatre a train of emotions
15014,55_amphetamine,55,amphetamine,Stimulants,just some at a lesser extent . the euphoria in particular seemed less intense and shorter . the extreme augmentation of my emotions was also present in a lesser during DATE
15015,6_amphetamine,6,amphetamine,Stimulants,to eat at my favorite restaurant with my parents i had to tell them i pass . i feeling kind of sick . ' the stomach pains and appetite suppression were

15017,38_amphetamine,38,amphetamine,Stimulants,extra ORG in the afternoon because i felt like it was wearing off a lot quicker . i also dropped down to lbs at one point and i felt great about
15018,19_amphetamine,19,amphetamine,Stimulants,true issues to brood on this never gets to extreme and usually goes away relatively quickly . i feel wide awake well into the night usually i start to wear out
15019,67_amphetamine,67,amphetamine,Stimulants,again when i wake a pill crushed up and railed gives me an average high time of hours . not worth it at all the drip is worse than meth and
15020,52_amphetamine,52,amphetamine,Stimulants,and i really enjoyed the feeling i was having . now i head to last period and hour and a half of ib theatre then followed by a hour rehearsal .
15021,26_amphetamine,26,amphetamine,Stimulants,the state my brain goes into once an epiphany occurs . the thoughts came so quickly and so naturally that i was on a higher level . during improv games i
15022,12_2c-i,12,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,favor of this new substance . the after affects were general relaxation and hours mildly slowed reaction time . sensitivity to light for hours . on subsequent trips we mixed mushrooms
15023,11_amphetamine,11,amphetamine,Stimulants,times . when the frustration got the best of me i looked over that the clock it was now am . there was just no way i was going to go
15024,26_amphetamine,26,amphetamine,Stimulants,idle thoughts had been unlocked awakened . when i got home i had an hour long conversation with my mom about how i was going to turn my life around .
15025,37_amphetamine,37,amphetamine,Stimulants,high but it would make me feel good and DATE DATE would go by really fast . it sounded neat so down the hatch . there was my first of tweak
15026,17_amphetamine,17,amphetamine,Stimulants,so bad . as i mentioned speed fills a hole in my life as it slowly rips it bigger . i had that hole filled and i want it filled again
15027,40_amphetamine,40,amphetamine,Stimulants,i were both introverts and never made friends easily . i always had the hardest time sitting down and reading for more than minutes at a placeholder but i usually brushed
15028,26_amphetamine,26,amphetamine,Stimulants,and concisely state my thoughts to people although my mind is going a hundred times faster than my fingers can type . i just got off the phone with my father
15029,92_amphetamine,92,amphetamine,Stimulants,i really am . you know that false sense of self that it gives over time i became that person and when i try to quit i ca even begin to
15030,48_amphetamine,48,amphetamine,Stimulants,coke only a little less ' feeling and without the numbing qualities and naturally much longer lasting during the next hours i was absolutely railed onto my paper . i would
15031,37_amphetamine,37,amphetamine,Stimulants,and drug induced self belief and authority . of course my high would last much longer than the performance i generally not sleep that night and be worn out for DATE
15032,6_amphetamine,6,amphetamine,Stimulants,act ended and i returned to the green room i thought i was going to pass out or throw up . i sat down breaking into a cold sweat noticing that

15034,80_amphetamine,80,amphetamine,Stimulants,graphite pencils which never really i sat down and took a few deep breaths and slowly started to interpret the model . usually i take a few minutes just measuring and
15035,80_amphetamine,80,amphetamine,Stimulants,planning out my drawings but this placeholder i decided to just jump right in . time passed in the blink of an eye and i soon realized that the first block
15036,19_amphetamine,19,amphetamine,Stimulants,and happy to be alive . hours of sleep brought me back to a normal pace . after notes it was an amazing night though the after effects hurt like a
15037,57_2c-i,57,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,best be compared to something from an animated movie . he fat and has a long snout . on the tip of said snout there a black sphere . he the
15038,40_amphetamine,40,amphetamine,Stimulants,nicely and we have all been friends since way back so it was nice spending time with them . i was completely enjoying every aspect of it . i dropped the
15039,57_amphetamine,57,amphetamine,Stimulants,to take these differently . i read somewhere about crushing up xr to negate the extended release and get the full strength at once . i unsure how true this is
15040,54_amphetamine,54,amphetamine,Stimulants,results of taking i go to a computer repair class at vocational school from to period everyday so after first period i get on the bus to leave for GPE .

15043,6_amphetamine,6,amphetamine,Stimulants,out was not going to happen . after drinking some water cola and taking a short walk to empty my stomach vomit we agreed to part ways and i smsd them
15044,27_amphetamine,27,amphetamine,Stimulants,. nothing like the hallucinogens just small visual disturbances . maybe cause of the pupil dilation . sometimes i get vertigo and lightheadedness when i stand up . nothing too negative
15045,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,otherwise i prefer not to . i can definitely relax more easily . thinking is slower but by no means harder . memory decreases a bit the usual effects of marijuana
15046,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,soon forget them but combined with adderall i stare about whatever i noticed for a long time then suddenly realize i been zoning out . overall cannabis helps to balance out
15047,48_amphetamine,48,amphetamine,Stimulants,. coke will hopefully come sometime soon i been itching to try it for a long time now . i always seemed to be an uppers kind of guy . this
15048,38_amphetamine,38,amphetamine,Stimulants,what it should have been doing and that it was doing this at exactly the time that it is supposed before my church youth group we returned to my friends house
15049,19_amphetamine,19,amphetamine,Stimulants,i felt exactly the same as i had before if not better . as the time reached around in the evening i decided to go to bed seeing as how i
15050,19_amphetamine,19,amphetamine,Stimulants,i had no real choice but to lie in bed until which is the usual time i wake up for because i had barely slept the night before i begged my
15051,5_amphetamine,5,amphetamine,Stimulants,was definitely a stronger effect . the trip seems to last the same amount of time but once i arrived at school the effects were much stronger than the previous .

15053,81_amphetamine,81,amphetamine,Stimulants,drug for medicinal purposes i took but it was spread out over a to hour period . mg at am more whenever i needed it like doing homework at night so
15054,73_amphetamine,73,amphetamine,Stimulants,guessed it masturbate . please pardon my bluntness . i could do it several times longer than i normally could . once i believe i must have gone at it for
15055,60_amphetamine,60,amphetamine,Stimulants,using dozens of paper towels rather than just stepping into the shower i became so speedy mentally that my body could not keep up . i became ineffecient paradoxically to the

15057,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,much more fluid rate than normally even after smoking large quantities of marijuana which normally slows down my perception of time . alright so those were the basic effects i noticed
15058,27_amphetamine,27,amphetamine,Stimulants,to feeling mostly to touch and pain dry mouthtwitching of the feet at a higher rate than normalever increasing clarity of hallucinations both auditory and visualoverall numb feeling developing toward life
15059,27_amphetamine,27,amphetamine,Stimulants,the most intense hallucinations and numb feeling toward life occurring toward the end of that period of time . so as you can imagine my mind began to ORG itself and
15060,15_amphetamine,15,amphetamine,Stimulants,none was being increased appreciation for increased curiosity for life nature and the stillness of time proceeding in a more fluid sense of time being highly distorted as time appeared to

15062,35_amphetamine,35,amphetamine,Stimulants,badly . i popped the two i usually took then four more . i worked rapidly but i found that my thoughts were less connected even with the upped amount .
15063,38_amphetamine,38,amphetamine,Stimulants,i pretty thankful that they just grinned and barred it and made it an excellant time for next we decided to go on the huge nearly ft tall or so ORG
15064,67_amphetamine,67,amphetamine,Stimulants,this state . i remembered thinking that people who use meth and stay up for long periods of time begin to hallucinate i was about to get kinda freaked out before
15065,66_amphetamine,66,amphetamine,Stimulants,was sad i cry . now i barely fazed . of course most of the time the buzz is as great but that only if i had popped one within hours
15066,19_amphetamine,19,amphetamine,Stimulants,up but it has to be doing something to help me stay awake i usually pass out around or . staying up past midnight is a very rare occasion for me
15067,35_amphetamine,35,amphetamine,Stimulants,. the effect wears off at about and i start at . that means the duration of the medication effect with time release is about hours . i did not use

15069,35_amphetamine,35,amphetamine,Stimulants,i realized going over the recommended dose again would only make matters worse in the long run . even if that effect remained for a long time to come eventually it
15070,6_amphetamine,6,amphetamine,Stimulants,i was nauseous but also knew that if i did not eat i would likely pass out later on in the after lunch i went to science class and i was

15072,55_amphetamine,55,amphetamine,Stimulants,i still feel fairly euphoric and my focus is still improved . i been reading long news articles online nothing really that interesting but i was able to dissect the story
15073,55_amphetamine,55,amphetamine,Stimulants,i became so dependent without even realizing it . once i experienced the euphoria i quickly felt as though i was boring and not myself without it . ordinary life seemed
15074,47_2c-i,47,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,will destroy that which you do not like it produces immediate effects but in the long run it will usually end in destruction since you will face the consequences of revenge
15075,14_amphetamine,14,amphetamine,Stimulants,to sort through . i also became heavily habituated to marijuana and tobacco during this period mainly to offset or accentuate the all of this has led me to now .
15076,85_amphetamine,85,amphetamine,Stimulants,irritated by everything . like now i am at school writing this and i so speedy i keep trying to type too fast so i make a mistake and i go

17268,13_dipt,13,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,sound and time have been warped together to form a sort of continuum . its time that being processed differently and not sound itself at all . maybe our internal clocks
17269,2_dipt,2,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,of music this is much less intense . feeling good from the walk and no longer trapped in my house i decide to walk back and try some more music .
17270,17_dipt,17,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,are the effects asymptotic at what point will they level out only the passage of time will answer these questions . however just when i think i am following a predictable
17271,17_dipt,17,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to answer my previous sounds still do seem to be getting deeper albeit it a slower and subtler rate . i would describe the progression of effects as being certainly asymptotic

17276,2_dipt,2,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a flat thing it is as if every sound is constantly in the process of slowing down . you just never really get used to the effect . and that is
17277,2_dipt,2,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and it sounded a bit different but i put my finger on it . as time progressed music started getting more and more different . it seemed like it was playing

17388,35_diphenhydramine,35,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,far i am getting conflicting advice . some say heart damage from the elevated heart rate such high dosages bring . some say liver damage as my body tries to flush
17389,38_diphenhydramine,38,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,i survived that night and have not approached that many ORG at once in a long time . so part of me is trying to survive i guess . why do

17403,108_diphenhydramine,108,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,took effort . i do remember if this was in my dreams or in the time when i was awake but i do remember that i spoke a lot less because
17404,28_diphenhydramine,28,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,the first set of ten . we had all the pills down as my stopwatch passed the six minute mark . we had also consumed two cokes each . as crazy

17463,21_diphenhydramine,21,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,was the scariest night of my life . i actually went into the sleep state faster than i done so in a while . i do remember any dreams which i
17464,40_diphenhydramine,40,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,by now i given up on trying to communicate with my friends . half the time they are real and when they are i ca remember what i was saying .

17467,26_diphenhydramine,26,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,to speak about it . would just ask are you talking about ' prompting a quick mind ' it was not that thoughts disappeared but that of thoughts were lost .
17468,3_diphenhydramine,3,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,over at me . we would make eye contact . yup definitely some placeholder has passed . all of my friends are now asleep . this is where things started to
17469,2_diphenhydramine,2,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,i decided to play some turbofolk on yotube and my god did it sound the time now was about and i felt pretty good . i went full retarded mode and
17470,6_dipt,6,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,of course it not that i had fun throwing up but it was a very quick action free of most discomfort when building up to it and i felt much better
17471,23_dipt,23,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,that way but just lying still may have done a lot of that too . quickly after smoking visual effects that had been present before increased slightly but did not really
17472,35_dipt,35,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,some of the dose since it was in a capsule and probably absorbing a little slower than the mipt had notable since the purge happened at pretty much the exact same
17473,103_dipt,103,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,PERSON and PERSON were not so bad and sounded mostly normal for most of the time but they were really the only ones even including random extras . PERSON and PERSON
17474,7_dipt,7,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,while after that but then i believe completely by an unfortunate coincidence i started very rapidly feeling sicker as DATE DATE went by . and i do mean sick as in
17475,16_dipt,16,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,psychedelics like this one may be better suited for producing powerful effects via a more rapid administration like insufflation or vaporization . it just seemed to me to be like those
17476,82_dipt,82,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,so they were down like to freebase . the dipt was then soaked in for long enough to evaporate most of it . some stuck to the sides of the glass
17477,10_dipt,10,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i felt quite terrified . despite the feelings of dissociation feeling trapped in a time loop i could still manage to understand that i was being watched by concerned sober

17479,6_dipt,6,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,that dipt has a nauseating undertone that needs to be controlled as well as a long duration at higher doses . i elected to sublingually absorb it . the dose was
17480,115_diphenhydramine,115,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,done i still had it on . i got bored of the yotube videos very quickly so i tried to find new ones . the problem was when i would type
17481,58_dipt,58,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,in the end i just need to put more effort into studying and spend less time sitting around being unproductive which admittedly i do a fair amount of . it was
17482,3_dipt,3,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,excited about this but also very skeptical . at the placeholder i did have the time or to explore and nobody here responded with a similar experience so i got even
17483,53_dipt,53,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,have a chance to put the pipe down and notice something is happening . i slowly launch into a strong tryptamine buzz with moderately strong visual distortions but no visions .
17484,18_dipt,18,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,about the chemical or its proper dossage and i began to get worried but it quickly passed . deciding to spare his nasal cavity of the tortures b and i had
17485,4_dipt,4,dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,sounds with and reassuring that he heard the same thing at the same place and time that i did . i began to become extremly aware of everyone position in the
17486,11_diphenhydramine,11,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,least once every ten minutes or so . the last placeholder i remember seeing a clock was at pm after then i lost complete track of time and became quite irrational
17487,10_diphenhydramine,10,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,five and i still feel all in all it was an interesting experiment but the extended hangover is a serious drawback . although the experience was somewhat enjoyable the sluggish and
17488,77_diphenhydramine,77,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,trying to creep myself out . it worked . if i looked at my reflection long enough it would wink or look to the side which was as unnerving as i
17489,3_diphenhydramine,3,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,. i start having this weird pain in my upper left chest area but it quickly dissipates . t i very excited at this placeholder and convinced that i will not
17490,45_diphenhydramine,45,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,i decide to dance for them . every else looks like they having a shitty time so i might as well be the entertainment being that my body feels like lead
17491,24_diphenhydramine,24,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,they laugh at what a jackass i making of myself . my vision seems to slow down to about frames per second and i ca keep up with what going on

17493,23_diphenhydramine,23,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,would disappear . i really wanted to smoke so i was PERSON and kept reaching faster and faster . so pissed off i lied back in my bed . later that
17494,21_diphenhydramine,21,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,from the store and i enter into the dream for another placeholder while the addiction slowly consumes my everything slipped away piece by piece and in a homeless shelter i now
17495,42_diphenhydramine,42,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,my bed i undressed and got to work on my self . it did take long with the dirt filthy images that came into my mind stuff that normally would be
17496,85_diphenhydramine,85,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,spell of the dph control and would come back to my present moment for brief periods of time . i went to my computer it was locked . i typed the

17498,57_diphenhydramine,57,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,it would not fall apart during a haul . i blew unbelievably massive clouds that quickly formed into the shapes of floating morphing spiders . every car that came my way
17499,5_diphenhydramine,5,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,that has taken PERSON knows that it pretty much rapes your memory for the whole duration of the trip . standing in the middle of the living room i completely forget
17500,42_diphenhydramine,42,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,. i remember bowing my head a lot because of the heavy sedation during which time i would completely forget where i was and what i was on . then i
17501,19_diphenhydramine,19,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,' i was definitely feeling better . decided to get some sleep maybe an hour long nap . welp i woke up hours later . it been a day or so
17502,21_diphenhydramine,21,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,but return to bed . my sleep after that was in segments about six hours long full of disjointed jarring dreams each placeholder i woke up i was a bit less
17503,45_diphenhydramine,45,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,i felt much more creative than normal and would find myself able to freestyle for longer than i ever had and easily at that . but i also found myself having
17504,11_diphenhydramine,11,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,of drool on the pillow my head was on . i looked at the same clock as before and it was am . i made my way to my bedroom and
17505,10_diphenhydramine,10,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,finally i woke up that morning feeling sleepy and gross from sweating . i was time for the dreaded hangover . i had to go to a meeting with my guidance
17506,47_diphenhydramine,47,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,effects . at first i was excited to experience something that i had gone so long without . my memories of the night are still a bit skewed but i do
17507,19_diphenhydramine,19,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,being pulled into sleep by it is pleasant and soothing . it is great for long travels on buses or getting to bed early on a DATE sleep and orgasm at
17508,70_diphenhydramine,70,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,doses . i can become paranoid at this stage . it always seems when i pass a group of talking people that they start to follow me . i look back
17509,6_diphenhydramine,6,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,what i actually sounded i briefly felt extremely nauseous and considered vomiting but the feeling passed or i forgot about eventually my willpower caved in and i decided to go to
17510,42_diphenhydramine,42,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,pop and sat my ass on this chair infront of my computer . i waited longer than normal for that one to kick in i almost started thinking it was nt
17511,20_diphenhydramine,20,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,the death of my neigbor earlier so i grabbed my sks again and had a long enough attention span to get the clip and bullets that i stashed from myself grabbed

17515,58_diphenhydramine,58,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,pass from the teacher after some slurred dull speaking and went to my actual first period . when i entered the teacher asked for a pass and i continuously gave her
17516,23_diphenhydramine,23,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,to suddenly the smoke begins turning into vapor spiders that start to crawl and skitter rapidly along the floor and occasionally onto my bed i look at them curiously swatting at
17517,16_dmt,16,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,it sucked me inside it . at this point my conscious mind is falling through endless patterns and figures and is being shown everything the psychedelic world has to offer .
17518,57_dmt,57,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the wave was forwards as i was looking backwards . movements in general felt very rapid as if it took no effort at all . there were some aspects of rapid
17519,40_dmt,40,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,feeling somewhat starved for some experiential nourishment . i would not go hungry for much longer greetings and hugs were exchanged and then we quickly fell into deep conversation . after
17520,45_dmt,45,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. the highlight of the show was the dancing the music had taken on a slow sexy groove when i noticed the buddha sitting in his classic pose . all the
17521,7_dmt,7,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,should throw down DATE DATE for a sack when it in town again . as time went along dimitri kept in the shadows till DATE DATE DATE after i first heard
17522,50_dmt,50,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was about to embark on the craziest journey of my life . i exhaled slowly and only had seconds to lay the bong down as well as lie down myself
17523,0_dmt,0,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,asked me how i was doing . i must have had my head bent too long looking down . i lift my head and tell her cool . during this moment
17524,11_dmt,11,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,my room i asked myself how long i had been tripping could nt read the clock . my pipe was next to me i told myself to put it away was

17526,47_dmt,47,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was still rattled . the final effects faded minutes after injection . just in time to get to having survived the ordeal i was very excited . i called a
17527,8_dmt,8,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the word drug changed meaning . the word went under numerous changes in pitch and length . the word was stretched out . in this dimension the word had marked my
17528,44_dmt,44,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a very specific taste which i describe and an intense electrical feeling . as it slowly trickled down my throat and through my body every cell of my being was penetrated
17529,17_dmt,17,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,like the falling of an object toward the LOC . at first the object falls slowly enough energy directed upward may overcome the downward motion and return the object to its

17562,35_dmt,35,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,it approved of me . the spot light was on me and only me . time am final dose . about mg in a bowl of weed my friend d walked
17563,45_dmt,45,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. when i stopped dancing the true nature of thgings around me became clear . time and space were so badly distorted . that i could barely walk inside . i
17564,42_dmt,42,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i had to sit back down as there was nothing to hold on to and steady myself on even though i was in my living room standing next to a wall
17565,89_dmt,89,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,great hands . he is my guru . i take a piss about times and pace in a room to psych myself up into the ritual . he has layered the
17566,18_dmt,18,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,friend about not wanting path of the evening to diverge away from and resolved to slow down on the powders as i wanted to have a fairly clear head . my
17567,14_dmt,14,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and i smoked some cannabis and got all ORG out . at about pm my long distance guide gave me a pep talk . checked the dosage i had measured out
17568,38_dmt,38,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was still completely distrought over losing . for the ORG minuets that seemed like an eternity i was enlightened and comforted by both the ORG and my mama . they both
17569,32_dmt,32,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,off ecstacy but with the taste of iron and stomach energy like lsd . i quickly switched the lights off and had a very pleasant experience completely but i could see
17570,31_dmt,31,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and the peaks lasted probably each . again it was very difficult to maintain a timeline or judge time spans . i wrote the notes minutes after coming down the last
17571,18_dmt,18,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,never snorted it . i was a little skeptical at first because i prefer the shorter duration of the smoked dmt experience . i knew that dmt could be very intense
17572,31_dmt,31,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,said ' definitely off baseline ' . i was in disbelief it here i was accelerating at a faster and faster rate and they were even into the first phase .
17573,32_dmt,32,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,as well as my last experience with lsd i was afraid of it for a long time . hence why i had it sitting around for so long . probably spurred
17574,11_dmt,11,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,at this moment its been about to seconds after last hit . it feels like time has stopped . no time . no sense of me no conscious no identification with
17575,66_dmt,66,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i could feel a distinct altered feeling the buzz . my body began to feel slow and heavy like i was being magnetically pulled towards the ground . about minutes after
17576,88_2c-e,88,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,of this i was not able to focus on the positives . the intricacy and duration of my hallucinations did not grow with the dose and my main feeling during the
17577,33_2c-e,33,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,for another hour at the very least so i be smoking a bowl momentarily to pass the placeholder until my trip takes t not a whole lot more yet and still
17578,34_dmt,34,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE DATE DATE to try it with a close friend from college . eventually the time came to smoke the stuff so my friend and i got up in the morning
17579,44_dmt,44,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a very specific taste which i describe and an intense electrical feeling . as it slowly trickled down my throat and through my body every cell of my being was penetrated
17580,31_2c-e,31,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,my thoughts elsewhere if i wanted it to i just chose not visuals decreased fairly rapidly as the plateau ended . then i started to get a nasty headache which mg
17581,24_dmt,24,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and said the fuck is this ' with a smile of his head stretched into eternity and i heard what can only be described as an extra dimensional laughter . and
17582,0_dmt,0,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,exact moment in my life i would view her . camera views perceptions were changing rapidly . this became my perception . there was no tv . the camera views were
17583,0_dmt,0,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,loved how she made me feel and the fact that she had sacrificed her brief time of ' solely to entertain and please i was coming down . colors were offset
17584,34_dmt,34,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was given DATE DATE . i will give the instructions . breathe in deep short breaths opening your lungs up and increasing the blood flow to your lungs . almost

17586,37_dmt,37,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a nice midsummer day . by now the peak was done . i was no longer hallucinating but i was definitely not sober . i was still appreciating the high i
17587,45_dmt,45,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,any damage . i danced for some placeholder still feeling trippy and absolutely wonderful before slowly settling back down to enjoy the rest of the evening with the experience was awesome
17588,73_dmt,73,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i am going through a painful process that i need to get through as if slowing dying and being reborn with the buildup of trying to reach an orgasmic climax but
17589,32_dmt,32,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,by lsd or acid he may not even be a reliable source anymore . i passed the bulge off as just some bud and we got closer now i could see
17590,10_dmt,10,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i would ever come back or this perception lasted for about mins until i quite quickly slipped back to base level feeling not an unpleasant hangover this was my first experience
17591,49_dmt,49,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i have experienced with high dosages of shrooms yet much more powerful . it an acceleration a quickening a transition from pedestrian reality to the hyperspeed dmt realm . weird geometric
17592,55_dmt,55,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was euphoric . i had had an immense experience one i had desired for so long and i had come back safely all in the space of what felt like minutes
17593,44_2c-e,44,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,taste it at all which was probably a blessing . after writing my dose and time in my trip notebook i went on a short walk down the street . nothing
17594,21_dmt,21,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,almost like a dream can be after waking . now i do mean that over time i forgot these other half of my breakthroughs i mean i never knew what happened
17595,47_2c-e,47,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,will most likely decrease . a double edged sword this may give me some more time to reflect on the effects but may not produce strong enough effects to be notable
17596,11_dmt,11,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,trying to pull me back . i looked at the clock to see how much time had gone by and almost could believe that it has only been minutes . then
17597,38_dmt,38,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,life . as a spirituality tool it is amazing . however i feel like the longer lasting alternatives like ORG and ORG would lend to more ' from the experience rather
17598,10_dmt,10,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,just got diagnosed with cirhhosis of the liver due to drinking and does have very long to live . one of my best friends growing up died of alcohol failure at
17599,27_dmt,27,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,visual hallucinations . these patterns of pressure points on my body and face seem to rapidly move around as if my body is a skating rink and lots of miniature but
17600,12_dmt,12,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,understanding of who or where i am . PERSON however seems to produce confusion more rapidly with dose and it becomes difficult to maintain any train of thought . mushrooms are
17601,32_dmt,32,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,produce approximately the same styles of visuals when normalized to dose only with a different time course . the experience is unlike lsd or . i experience patterns of primary colored
17602,32_2c-e,32,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,to lsd but every once in a while a random queue will bring on a short surge of intense hallucination . these instances appear to occur only when i have been
17603,21_dmt,21,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i noticed very little aftereffect other than some stimulation mentally which i attribute to how rapidly my brain had been moving shortly before . that night i had lucid dreams .

17757,13_datura spp.,13,datura spp.,Deliriants,it seemed to stretch . much like a dxm trip i lost all reference of time . the only indicator was a digital clock which would have been impossible to read
17758,1_datura spp.,1,datura spp.,Deliriants,perhaps half an hour i began experiencing shortness of breath . my heart was beating rapidly and my thought processes had become muddled . i decided that removing my shirt and

17762,33_datura spp.,33,datura spp.,Deliriants,had come over but i was still in the back patio completely unaware of how long i was sitting there . i remember trying to pack a bowl a simple task
17763,42_datura spp.,42,datura spp.,Deliriants,sat on the bed waiting for something to happen and after minutes or so had passed i started thinking it must have been another dud pod . i sat up to

17765,21_datura spp.,21,datura spp.,Deliriants,the next morning when i saw the finally resting in my bed i fell asleep quickly . i had an extremely vivid and realistic dream of an invisible being grabbing me
17766,6_datura spp.,6,datura spp.,Deliriants,but i actually did nt puke . we were hallucinating it together . for a period my buddies thought they were at work and were working together in the kitchen thinking
17767,1_crack,1,crack,Stimulants,out . i went back inside to my room and lay down listening to how fast my heart was beating and wondering if something was wrong with me . i was

17769,57_cocaine,57,cocaine,Stimulants,pace even at mph in a and he stayed right on my ass . i slowed down to so he could pass me and the fucker stayed right on my ass
17770,34_cocaine,34,cocaine,Stimulants,i was just really tired from smoking so much during DATE DATE . i was passing out at my house so i decided to drink a whole lot of coca tea
17771,44_cocaine,44,cocaine,Stimulants,the taste was not palatable at all but as the night went on i would quickly grow to crave tasting the i was ready to take a little walk alone and
17772,36_cocaine,36,cocaine,Stimulants,the back and decide a bit full for the moment . about two hours has passed since we started and night has begun to fall so we bring the platter into
17773,57_cocaine,57,cocaine,Stimulants,to chop out four rails and we will have a race as soon as the clock hits coming down so this is a great idea . i chop them out and
17774,13_cocaine,13,cocaine,Stimulants,a great idea . i chop them out and each line is about a foot long regular width regular height . crazy maybe . well the clock definetly hit and we
17775,34_cocaine,34,cocaine,Stimulants,and went DATE DATE DATE i woke up to a lawn that needed mowing . time for cocaine i blew a big line and mowed the whole damn lawn in under
17776,86_cocaine,86,cocaine,Stimulants,and i had to take a piss every five minutes . that night i thought long and hard about what those evangelists had said the night before . i am a
17777,2_cocaine,2,cocaine,Stimulants,so i will guess it was about before any additional adulteration probably more like at time nothing had happened yet . i listened to some at time i began feeling similar
17778,10_cocaine,10,cocaine,Stimulants,and want to take a nap . i had another drink and tried to at time i still wanted to do another line but i told myself that this decision would
17779,10_cocaine,10,cocaine,Stimulants,energy and everything felt like it was on that i could also process things much faster and more accurately than when i was sober . eventually we switched to mario brothers
17780,36_cocaine,36,cocaine,Stimulants,and snorted that . in two minutes i was back in my happiest it is time for dinner with my family . i am not hungry at all . i do
17781,37_cocaine,37,cocaine,Stimulants,that perfect high that perfect bliss and as such i spent a good amount of time looking into getting a one day my adderall dealer finally came through and waltzed into
17782,49_cocaine,49,cocaine,Stimulants,on shrooms . i walked around and around campus making sure to breath deeply and slowly and not walk too fast . walking did help relieve a bit of the anxiety
17783,34_cocaine,34,cocaine,Stimulants,hurt my lungs DATE DATE DATE and second because i found using it for an extended period of time made me and withdrawn . anyway i recently had another opportunity to
17784,101_cocaine,101,cocaine,Stimulants,i guessed to be about a third of a gram . i did the lines quickly following the same procedure as before . this placeholder i noticed a larger rush of
17785,47_cocaine,47,cocaine,Stimulants,provided . that really did happen to me and in fact coming up was really slow . i did notice the exact second i felt any effects but i did feel
17786,23_cocaine,23,cocaine,Stimulants,off and i never get i hate this stuff only positive aspect is that i slowed down consumption of cigarettes by quite a mins later i still feel slightly numb .
17787,37_cocaine,37,cocaine,Stimulants,and listen to friends when they say you should stop getting high . just set periods of when you do touch the stuff stick to it and you do more than
17788,9_cocaine,9,cocaine,Stimulants,color extending from the center of the web in a rough circle with edges that slowly fluctuated in different distances from the center . this fluctuating blob had a very similar
17789,50_cocaine,50,cocaine,Stimulants,close by i would try again . i bought a bag and waited for a slow period . when the others were taking a smoke break i decided to take my
17790,11_cocaine,11,cocaine,Stimulants,i stripped down to my boxers turned on a fan and purposefully covered my alarm clock . i definately did not want to be able to see the time . i
17791,12_cocaine,12,cocaine,Stimulants,scattered cravings for some blow . i mentioned that we spent a considerable amount of time in GPE on this trip where i ended up having a very introspective mushroom trip
17792,58_cocaine,58,cocaine,Stimulants,i was a junior i realized that i was getting dumb . i could no longer perform complex mental operations especially in math which used to be my best subject .
17793,67_cocaine,67,cocaine,Stimulants,uppers go by a longshot but it definately has major drawbacks especially the tremendous and long comedown . meth took me DATE to control and learn to resist taking more while
17794,74_codeine,74,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,over after my jaw had healed and intrigued by my initial reaction i did some quick research on the internet . surely the authorities would allow an easily abused opiate to
17795,-1_codeine,-1,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,past an hour later and the effects begin to wear off . the intensity fades slowly over a couple of hours . the rest of DATE DATE and perhaps the next
17796,11_codeine,11,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,couple of hours . the rest of DATE DATE and perhaps the next i feel slowed down slightly dumber than for DATE DATE DATE DATE after discovering how wonderfully enjoyable the
17797,-1_codeine,-1,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,but the closest i came to that was some very mild cravings during my initial period of use and mild curiosity about stronger opiates . i avoided using it on any
17798,-1_codeine,-1,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,few housemates that i get along well with . i had a bit of a slow lazy day and was feeling calm and nice but quite bored . i decided i
17799,-1_codeine,-1,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,i wait for it to after thoroughly filtering my solution i drink it down as fast as i can before chasing it with another beer . the only negative i found
17800,13_codeine,13,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,or a handful of oxys . i having a lot of trouble keeping track of time it seems to be passing either very fast very slow or both somehow . i
17801,-1_codeine,-1,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,or poor quality filter and have wasted a batch . if you have plenty of time use two filters one inside the other . i mix with grapefruit juice and ice

17803,-1_coffea spp.,-1,coffea spp.,Stimulants,everything seemed ready to contort violently though nothing did . my eyes were still blinking rapidly . i turned again on my side and tried to fall back into a more

17806,64_coffea spp.,64,coffea spp.,Stimulants,to the point where i sleep at night so i finally decided now is the time to quit caffeine . i knew i would experience withdrawal . what i know was
17807,-1_coffea spp.,-1,coffea spp.,Stimulants,noticing that it does feel good not to be so amped up all of the time it does feel good not to be so amped up all of the time .

17813,28_codeine,28,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,it was these pills that forced me into an overdose . i will detail the timeline of that night as i was shocked at quite how late after i took them
17814,6_codeine,6,codeine,Depressant / sedatives,on the pc got some nice tunes going and set myself up for a nice slow night . now i began to feel sick . fine i thought i heard about

17976,35_diphenhydramine,35,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,small amounts . also since i am a insulin dependent diabetic i get paranoid and quickly run upstairs to get my reaction candy tester and insulin vials and syringes . i
17977,77_diphenhydramine,77,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,by my own reflection because i did nt even recognize my own self . i quickly ran away back to the couch i was previously sitting my heart began to beat
17978,12_diphenhydramine,12,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,hallucinating . that all it is . at first it is quite exhilerating but as time passed i really started to lose grip . it not like mushrooms or acid where

17982,9_diphenhydramine,9,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,thing is that the room started to change shape a little bit like it would slowly stretch out to a shape then to a diamond and back to normal over the
17983,9_diphenhydramine,9,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,think the darkness may have something to do with triggering them . it lessened over time and i can usually tell that what is happening is not real and just close

17987,24_diphenhydramine,24,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,wore her glasses i could stop giggling . the effects were minor for the first period which lasted minutes . then we had advisory which was minutes i sat down and
17988,23_2c-e,23,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,smoking it but it does seem to make the trip come on a little bit faster and a little bit smoother but this could very well be a placebo effect .
17989,47_diphenhydramine,47,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,for the count . the immedeate effects were extremely mellow . my body seemed to slow to a crawl and wheather my timing was messed up or what walking very short
17990,41_diphenhydramine,41,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,to class and about minutes after taking them my eyes started to feel a little slow it had already started taking effect which surprising considering i had only had a bowl
17991,47_diphenhydramine,47,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,after a few minutes i realised that the effects would become too intense within a short while and attempted to message a friend who had agreed to be around as an

17993,16_diphenhydramine,16,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,. there was no sense of psychedelic insight just a sense that my mind was slowing down thoughts were more difficult to form and input from outside was more difficult to
17994,64_diphenhydramine,64,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,caffeine pills and waited trying to pay attention to my pulse while still experiencing the short term memory loss and constantly losing count . the effort of getting the pills from

17996,16_diphenhydramine,16,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,and psylocibes and the visuals have drifted out of my vision during the same placeholder period as the psychedelic usage . even though i am not affected any more i am
17997,10_diphenhydramine,10,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,gone too far that night and so they gave me two valium and i immediately passed out . i awoke early the next morning feeling more or less sober and infinitely

18000,13_diphenhydramine,13,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,anymore to me because it simply did matter what time it was . what was time anyway an abstract idea . why put so much emphasis on this idea so meaningless
18001,9_diphenhydramine,9,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,looked as though it was covered in a film of tiny droplets of mineral oil slowly dripping down the screen around the library . the grain of the wood on the
18002,20_diphenhydramine,20,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,to do will i hit it or avoid it i had pretty much decided to slow down and go around it since it was sitting still . all this took place
18003,26_diphenhydramine,26,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,i was thinking nor could i actually stay on one train of thought for any length of time or remember what my response was to someone by the placeholder they stopped

18006,59_diphenhydramine,59,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,injected of diphenhydramine at about . i had difficulty finishing the injection due to the rapid effects . i tried to stand to get a cotton ball and throw away the
18007,64_diphenhydramine,64,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,get into the story i took nine pills of diphenhydramine and washed them down with brisk iced team mg caffeine . i had a small breakfast and started walking to school
18008,6_diphenhydramine,6,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,and clumsy . that how my feet felt . the nausea set in during first period too . there was a feeling in my stomach that i had a burp that
18009,26_diphenhydramine,26,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,had been before i blanked out . i do recall any thoughts that may have passed through my mind at that point except on occasions when i had imaginary conversations with
18010,60_diphenhydramine,60,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,over minutes at a placeholder so i decided to take a shower just to waste time and do something else so i drunkenly walked to the bathroom seeing things being different
18011,68_2c-e,68,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,could help but feel that i had figured out too much i had touched intelligent infinity and it was a daunting prospect to say the least to realize that every being
18012,42_diphenhydramine,42,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,were rolling right across every surface of every wall and ceiling . i think i passed out on a bed into the tv room because the next thing i could remember
18013,10_dimenhydrinate,10,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,goal it just like aimlessly wondering through an illogical funhouse . the intoxication onset comes quickly ussually over a period of minutes the body feels extremly heavy and awkward as if
18014,23_datura spp.,23,datura spp.,Deliriants,have a cigarette . i ca be sure what happened between the point where i passed out and the point where the cops picked me up trying to pick up an
18015,2_datura spp.,2,datura spp.,Deliriants,cd and replacing it with some good ol ' novembre my favorite band of all time to make sure he remembered to lock the door after letting everyone in i not
18016,39_datura spp.,39,datura spp.,Deliriants,me and my brother a datura tree . it was a normal day after lunch time and we were all felling pretty good . the white flowers were big but i
18017,21_datura spp.,21,datura spp.,Deliriants,whole thing to be over . i was flushed and cold and overstimulated and i passed in and out of sleep . i had an incredible number of dreams so vivid
18018,34_datura spp.,34,datura spp.,Deliriants,DATE . what i noticed is a pretty sharp increase in effects with each sucsessive time i smoked . the initial effects were general feelings of wierdness gravitational pulls coming from
18019,7_datura spp.,7,datura spp.,Deliriants,also felt very sick afterwards for DATE DATE and was just generally bizzare for DATE slow moving small attention span although some ORG may disagree with me i found the best
18020,40_2c-e,40,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,engineering design group and a couple other people i had seen around from placeholder to time . acquaintances yes but i was having a blast talking to them and listening to
18021,14_datura spp.,14,datura spp.,Deliriants,smoked euphorically chasing that nice euphorical state mindlessly but carefully its kind of like cannabis duration wise and how long the peak effects are after each toke though in total i
18022,31_datura spp.,31,datura spp.,Deliriants,the peak effects are after each toke though in total i think it wears off slower but more clearly . other than that i have been reading datura rapports of all
18023,31_datura spp.,31,datura spp.,Deliriants,the way this high sticks around it does nt feel like it will fade any time soon though the peak has quite a while ago . i really do nt know
18024,52_datura spp.,52,datura spp.,Deliriants,once ran into the side of the doorway when walking through it . about the time the movie ended my friend said he had to go outside to take piss .
18025,2_datura spp.,2,datura spp.,Deliriants,that i had the left the bathroom sink faucet running full tilt for an unknown length of time . colors and sounds were amplified . there were times when there were
18026,3_datura spp.,3,datura spp.,Deliriants,fat waxy all this was very enjoyable and i was lucid and even had a short conversation with PERSON who was really there this placeholder . later i went for a
18027,57_2c-e,57,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,look like the blades had stopped in place and then proceeded to turn around and accelerate very rapidly in the other direction . this effect was much akin to how a
18028,50_datura spp.,50,datura spp.,Deliriants,a bong but i had a bit of trouble controlling it . soon my heartbeat rate has significantly increased and my arms and legs started to feel really heavy . i
18029,14_datura spp.,14,datura spp.,Deliriants,subconsciously feel the presence of somebody else . i used to have similar feelings a long time ago when if i got really high on weed . once i sat down
18030,36_datura spp.,36,datura spp.,Deliriants,clapped your hand your face expression was unbearably funny confused and devastated but after a short while forget this and simply continue clashing . i do not remember the cookie thing
18031,33_datura spp.,33,datura spp.,Deliriants,were smoking a bowl . again completely forgetting i took datura i asked them to pass it . they seemed reluctant and asked me if i was sure i wanted it
18032,35_datura spp.,35,datura spp.,Deliriants,increased their dosage . w a bulkier larger guy took shot glass while q a shorter skinnier guy took and a half shot glasses . they were waiting for the effects
18033,5_datura spp.,5,datura spp.,Deliriants,being present and did see what was around me but these were way way too short for me to fully understand how serious the trip was all other times i had
18034,10_datura spp.,10,datura spp.,Deliriants,it . but i feel nauseous and sick as i would on alcohol and the time spent in this state was much more longer full hours compared to maybe hours in
18035,5_datura spp.,5,datura spp.,Deliriants,a report to erowid on this experience but it was and written with very little time to reflect on what actually went on during this trip . first of all let
18036,58_datura spp.,58,datura spp.,Deliriants,just sat back and watched the other students do their thing for most of the period until a girl i knew got up and threw up in the trashcan . i
18037,9_datura spp.,9,datura spp.,Deliriants,trying to look out but every placeholder i would look out to see the people passing by all there was was a wall in my face time was non existent to
18038,72_datura spp.,72,datura spp.,Deliriants,have i become am i really the slave of my morbid fantasies have i lived long enough to realize that my existence is meaningless i whisper to the ignorant silence aground
18039,7_datura spp.,7,datura spp.,Deliriants,. something had been drawing my attention to a motel jacuzzi DATE DATE as i passed by but i had no idea what it was . DATE DATE i figured out
18040,7_datura spp.,7,datura spp.,Deliriants,an entertaining story . it was such a nightmare i felt so lonely for so long still recovering DATE DATE DATE . i must inform people of the deadliness of the
18041,3_datura spp.,3,datura spp.,Deliriants,i would rather do manual labour next placeholder . i said the detention was too long that they allowed to keep us in for the night and that i would most
18042,76_datura spp.,76,datura spp.,Deliriants,took place in DATE . for my trip i used one large yellow flower about long and a green seedpod . i boiled the materials for minutes and then let it
18043,27_datura spp.,27,datura spp.,Deliriants,the weird thing is as soon as i convince myself that i am hallucinating reality slowly evolves as opposed to the opposite tendency in many dimenhydrinate nutmeg delirious states where reality
18044,27_datura spp.,27,datura spp.,Deliriants,to control my hallucinations to whatever i please however my mind registers information at a slower pace than visual observation so i have to be super aware that i am under
18045,104_datura spp.,104,datura spp.,Deliriants,i had a hard placeholder getting into the van because i had a hard enough time walking or anything else . they then took me to this clinic and got someone
18046,71_datura spp.,71,datura spp.,Deliriants,nonexistent word practically simultaneously . stoners have a tendency to do that from placeholder to time in my experience . we giggled and passed the joint as i tried to forget
18047,10_datura spp.,10,datura spp.,Deliriants,of PERSON and strained into a thermos as we planned to drink it at half time of an afl football match geelong vs GPE what were we thinking just for fun
18048,21_datura spp.,21,datura spp.,Deliriants,probably in my dream or delirium i was so out of touch with reality i quickly forgot what i was searching for so i started searching for another something what i
18049,104_datura spp.,104,datura spp.,Deliriants,it was our turn to see the nurse at the front desk i could no longer walk at all and i thought my mom was a fat man that ran a
18050,62_datura spp.,62,datura spp.,Deliriants,the afternoon we rolled out of bed . we both noticed the blurred vision which shortly wore off . his pupil were dialated for DATE DATE but mine were . i
18051,5_datura spp.,5,datura spp.,Deliriants,at all . all i saw was a smear . i looked at my computer clock and it was the same thing . that was the scariest part of the trip
18052,55_datura spp.,55,datura spp.,Deliriants,similar way with diphen with a lot more conscious euphoria . the sets in pretty quickly compared to diphen and is much worse . this could also be part of the
18053,13_datura spp.,13,datura spp.,Deliriants,them rather than keep track of the times i pretty much not paying attention to time at i read on wikipedia that the visual noise pattern is a common cev but
18054,43_datura spp.,43,datura spp.,Deliriants,my eye floaties seem to spawn flying bugs . a lot of the straight and long gui elements in my word processor wiggle and jiggle a bit . it is as
18055,43_datura spp.,43,datura spp.,Deliriants,this only happens when looking at stars it seems . doing magic eye and playing fast videah games seem to help get them calibrated faster an as i written this things
18056,60_datura spp.,60,datura spp.,Deliriants,other words made the whole place wet now i could take a shower i lost time again according to my mom i had started growling and banging on the door making

18058,8_datura spp.,8,datura spp.,Deliriants,the effect of the drug i felt like i had more concentration and could illicit slower and stronger effects . once i was imagining a scene from my personal history and
18059,10_datura spp.,10,datura spp.,Deliriants,drink . i managed to drink about oz . of the the effects came on quick minutes or less . my memories of what happened are spotty . the first thing
18060,21_datura spp.,21,datura spp.,Deliriants,i would lay on my bed and kick my legs and thrash around wildly for long intervals of time . i had realy vivid and some lucid dreams during the night
18061,8_datura spp.,8,datura spp.,Deliriants,i have not used drugs since then . PERSON was the first step in a long road of drug abuse and looking back i wish it scared be straight . i
18062,19_datura spp.,19,datura spp.,Deliriants,about minutes maybe an hour later i felt an odd feeling of warmth and contentment pass over me . and it a tinge of sleepiness but without the heavy eyelids .
18063,33_datura spp.,33,datura spp.,Deliriants,i barely ever see and i was just like are you talking about so i slowly drink the half glass then we head out front to smoke a couple bowls .
18064,14_datura spp.,14,datura spp.,Deliriants,constantly waiting for the effects of the ORG weed to take i ca say how long i sat until the seeds started working but the first noticable signs came in the
18065,26_datura spp.,26,datura spp.,Deliriants,the next evening i ate seeds . while falling asleep i experienced something like thought acceleration . it was as if my thoughts were in an area outside of where they
18066,14_datura spp.,14,datura spp.,Deliriants,recall feeling anything like this before definitely not the weed because it had taken so long for it to kick in i nailed another . bad mistake i should have rather
18067,12_2c-e,12,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,was the same thoughts mushrooms and PERSON gave me but they were coming and going fast . i could literally see my thoughts splitting apart inside my head at a rate
18068,13_dimenhydrinate,13,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,voices of people talking in the video started getting distorted like they were speaking in slow motion . whenever some guy was talking his voice would distort and i would hear
18069,69_2c-e,69,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,i wrote down when on the my mind set on a hella read this real fast as i rhyme and me ill flash back as i open my mind to the
18070,17_dimenhydrinate,17,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,anything . i asked to go outside ' i can see the earth revolving . fast is it going ' stef ' i do know its one of those miniature scoreboards
18071,6_dimenhydrinate,6,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,i woke up in the middle of the night feeling nauseous and did have enough time to reach the bathroom so i puked on my bedroom floor . it was too

18076,41_dimenhydrinate,41,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,DATE and just now starting to feel back to normal . my pupils are no longer huge but are still larger than normal and i have trouble focusing on things closer
18077,35_dimenhydrinate,35,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,not do this again anytime soon unless i really want to forget a day and pass out . i would never go above the dose either . the effects were so
18078,9_dimenhydrinate,9,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,region and noticed that my penis was dark blue almost black . i jumped up quickly and turned on the lights and it was gone back to normal color but as
18079,9_dimenhydrinate,9,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,the surface . i also noticed that if i stared at any white space for longer than a few seconds a whitish object that vaguely reminded me of a creamy looking
18080,32_dimenhydrinate,32,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,any lsd tonight he said he did know what happened and they asked him what time it was . he said . they were like no its in the morning son
18081,15_dimenhydrinate,15,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,different . very . ca explain that in any other way except that i felt time had slowed down a bit and i had slowed down more than time . this
18082,28_dimenhydrinate,28,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,was one hour after i had taken the pills . i still felt heavy and slow but not in the way i felt ten or fifteen minutes ago . now it

18084,9_dimenhydrinate,9,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,to flicker . like it was accidentally tuning into another reality . it was moving quickly back and forth . i looked at the wall for about minutes . then we
18085,1_dimenhydrinate,1,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,pushed against my skull than i get a horrible feeling in my stomach and i pace because my heart goes crazy and i ca nt lay down . all i did
18086,101_dimenhydrinate,101,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,was bored and had nothing to do . i figured tonight was as good a time as any to try again with the dimenhydrinate . approximately ingested gram dimenhydrinate in the
18087,10_dimenhydrinate,10,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,probably looked drunk myself as i would occasionally get these waves of from placeholder to time . besides that i found myself with some paranoia sort of a feeling like someone
18088,3_dimenhydrinate,3,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,happen every placeholder i do PERSON include these happen in other people accounts too i pass from the actual surrounding world i am in into a surreal world . everything may
18089,5_dimenhydrinate,5,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,messed i still did learn my lesson . i had some fairly good trips over time . i started to do it once a week twice a week about five times
18090,28_dimenhydrinate,28,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,might as well take bottles ' trip setting a friend house with of my closest time after experience i took pills i had chillin in my pocket . i then proceeded
18091,21_dimenhydrinate,21,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,name coz i do too ' yet there was no one there . i kept passing out and having these dreams like i was talking to people and PERSON kept waking
18092,80_dimenhydrinate,80,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,standing here shaving slithers off my fingers convinced that i holding a pencil ' that passed quickly enough though when i showed my brother what i had drawn thusfar and noted
18093,21_2c-e,21,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,up from them . i was also told i had vomited in my sleep a time or two but i think it was the stress from the dream and the inability
18094,21_2c-e,21,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,to much of it . this frightened me beyond belief as it was a droning timeline dream with many repetitions of my inadvertent the next thing i remember is a medical
18095,21_2c-e,21,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,that was not completely stressful or terrifying . highlights from my dream include a really long sequence of me and my buddy caught in a shifting cycle where our faces were
18096,103_dimenhydrinate,103,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,. if they can talk it comes out as incoherent mumbling . most of the time they sit with a blank and every couple of minutes have a muscle spasm that
18097,10_dimenhydrinate,10,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,like i do now after a few beers . my motor skills seeemed to be slower then usual especially walking afterstanding up . when i got to my next class my
18098,50_dimenhydrinate,50,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,bong hit and sat down . all hell broke loose . i felt my heart rate it was down to like beats per minute and if i was moving part of

18112,5_datura spp.,5,datura spp.,Deliriants,i was aware that i was tripping and that it was a friend of mine passed by my house this was real to get some buds and i managed to act
18113,52_datura spp.,52,datura spp.,Deliriants,since the other guy who had partaken of the smoothie was having a much harder time dealing with the scene than we anticipated . i was disappointed i had hoped to
18114,10_datura spp.,10,datura spp.,Deliriants,for evening to arrive . the brew was cabbage like and bitter not at all shortly after drinking we all fell asleep except for my friend who fought back the urge

18116,66_datura spp.,66,datura spp.,Deliriants,recipe for the buzz had just started to come on at that stage and it long at all before things went real wacky . i remember that after seeing my friend
18117,3_dimenhydrinate,3,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,good minutes nothing happened . i sat and listened to music surfing the web to pass the placeholder . when i resolved myself to the fact that i was wasting my
18118,42_dimenhydrinate,42,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,etc . rolled around and i reached a point where i could stay awake any longer . i sat up and stumbled over to my bed . my balance was quite
18119,42_dimenhydrinate,42,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,i was on . i kept telling them ' ' but that would slide for long . i got up and tore all the cushions from each couch and threw them
18120,14_dimenhydrinate,14,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,later on that evening the sensation was like having smoked a lot of weed a long time before compounded with being somewhat drunk sometimes i found myself reaching twice for lightswitches
18121,45_dimenhydrinate,45,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,the feeling started getting more and more intense . everything i looked at started dancing faster and faster i felt like i was going to puke then i focused at this
18122,19_dimenhydrinate,19,dimenhydrinate,Deliriants,was all it cracked up to be . then things started to go downhill really fast . at about i began to feel extremely tired and fatigued . i would try
18123,28_diazepam,28,diazepam,Depressant / sedatives,percent more of the drug eg or instead of to get the expected results and duration . so an hour after i took a second that pill also did not produce
18124,19_diazepam,19,diazepam,Depressant / sedatives,i did feel much like sleeping and i watched tv until which is the normal time i go to sleep . now here where it gets kind of weird i felt
18125,11_diazepam,11,diazepam,Depressant / sedatives,i do know how i got where i am . i look over at my clock and it reads although i do know where that hour and a half went .
18126,10_diazepam,10,diazepam,Depressant / sedatives,describe the feeling it would be i wished being drunk would be like . noticeable slowdown in typing speed and general mental capabilities . yawning but not really sleepy . in

18132,-1_dpt,-1,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,earlier i mistook the sense of detachment from the world i was experiencing during the time of the repetitions for a substantial decline in the trip intensity when in fact the
18133,-1_dpt,-1,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,decline in the trip intensity when in fact the trip had been declining far more slowly . i check the clock on my cell and see i only a little over
18134,-1_dpt,-1,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,phenomenon i experienced . because the that ended the repetitions was followed by a brief period of it is difficult to say for sure but i think i remember the essence
18135,27_dpt,27,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was expressed in my brain two seconds before . i see something intriguing about the duration of the trail hallucination that ended my experience of the repetitions that is the hallucination
18136,-1_dpt,-1,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,back on itself . i estimate it lasted just two seconds which is the same duration as that of the delay between my experience in the present and its in a

18142,100_dpt,100,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,if saying cloud was ever appropriate that truly would fit it . after some moments time was an observable pattern at this point i started to feel my mind completely and
18143,31_dpt,31,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,first hour of the trip was too bad compared to what came later . minutes passed as i gingerly came up and settled into the peak . i stared at the

18149,71_dpt,71,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,of pot i did nt feel very stoned . rather it seemed to prolong the time it took to come down . though i was tripping per se after oclock or
18150,38_dpt,38,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,power . part ORG part ORG part tryptamine with only though the minutes was still short it enabled easier collection of qualitative data and wore off quickly enough to discuss its
18151,1_dpt,1,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. it also leaves a strange burning sensation on my lips which lingers for the duration of the experience . immediately i feel my chest tighten up and my heart start

18185,8_dpt,8,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to easily rationalize that i was just on a drug and that it would eventually pass and that i should enjoy it . i am used to seizing control from the

18389,11_dpt,11,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was probably about an hour or so after use oh yeah i almost completely lose time perception when on dpt . one hour can feel like or the other way around
18390,17_dpt,17,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,it and they each have some vague duplicates and that just kinda fractales off into infinity . the duplicates leave tracers i think i about half an hour into it here
18391,26_dpt,26,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,sloshing around it . iver the next half hour it easier to hold onto thoughts longer and eventually they do change without me telling them i pretty far out of it
18392,17_dpt,17,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,back down into the fractal the next placeholder i surfaced i realized that the still slowing fractals represented universes in the sense of alternate universes all a part of the that
18393,15_dpt,15,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,on themselves then repeated the process . somehow i was dislodged from my universe and time was greatly sped up so i could see the entire universe field being born and

18395,13_dpt,13,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,in their form . this was why there was such a large ratio of chaos time to order time because there was only a single point at which the universes were

18397,26_dpt,26,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,me from freeing the idea from its bonds by grasping it enough to think and pass all in all this was a very insightful experience and had very few unpleasant effects

18399,33_dpt,33,dpt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to the spot and we matched bowls which brought back some of the effects . shortly after that my friend and i returned to our homes . we were only at

18457,38_dxm,38,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,been messing around with ORG recently and thought i share my personal experiences with it time drank a bottle of robitussin dxm . loved it since my roomie is deathly afraid

18460,1_dxm,1,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,. i was very light headed and thought i was going to die . i quickly scribbled information on a piece of paper to tell anyone that found me what i
18461,27_dxm,27,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,was very talkative . i felt like i was making sense and having an enjoyable time . i just felt spacy . there were no visual hallucinations but things did look

18463,35_dxm,35,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,me that the dose was fatal but if i had come in i might have passed out and probably would have continued to experience the symptoms for at least another hours
18464,1_dxm,1,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,put the tube in . i think it took several more hours for my heart rate to go back to normal . there was also a jittery twitchy feeling in the
18465,13_dxm,13,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,. that explains why things seem larger or smaller than usual in space and why time seems to speed up slow down or disappear entirely as if you were looking at
18466,17_dxm,17,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,like fading echoes the further and further changing more and more weather moving relative through time or possibility . it is the happiest nullification of the will question . all possible
18467,13_dxm,13,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,orderly existence . why all our perspectives share communication statistics similar order and locations within time . the best explanation i can come up with is that this is that this
18468,13_dxm,13,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,big for us to observe if they do not repeat themselves within our space and time so they would not look or act like patterns at all . kinds of patterns
18469,17_dxm,17,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,. the consciousness in other universes is parallel and exponential thus perpendicular and more beyond time . maybe waiting in black holes looking into everything at once in all possible ways
18470,13_dxm,13,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,. it might be a delusion of reference to this . gravity the weight of time density the wait of space in conclusion there are no true sanity must be there

18474,17_dxm,17,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,also want to say that of necessity an account of this sort of thing will rapidly pass the limit of linguistic coherence and must lapse into what from an analytic perspective

18477,17_dxm,17,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,as to whether or not its somethinghood was implied by or was part of the endless nothing . yet the very fact that it even flickered meant that it was indeed

18587,19_dxm,19,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,sleep . with the combination of bzp this is often a mildly euphoric probably more time where reading history books or listening to music is again enjoyable or epic . i
18588,18_dxm,18,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,snorted roughly mg total . i noticed a slight sting but nothing much and i slowly realized how fast it really hit me . it cut my wait time to about
18589,81_dxm,81,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,after i was telling myself that mg have never hurt anyone . lost track of time around after the sedative not helping at all the heart muscles seized up or so
18590,86_dxm,86,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,was much better . i went pee a whole buncha times . at about the clock became completely unreadable . i shut off the light and hit redial to call my

18592,21_dxm,21,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,was because of screwy time perception or if they really did go on for sleep time maybe i have a strong impression that i dreamed while asleep but i do remember
18593,37_dxm,37,dxm,Dissociative psychedelics,to the quarterdeck were the vending machine was but was stopped by someone asking the time . so i asked them if i looked high i know why i asked this
18594,14_dmt,14,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. even though i do smoke cannabis i could get anxiety attacks . though the duration of the attack was longer and more severe when i was on sorry if that
18595,26_dmt,26,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,them all like a chorus of whistles . suddenly a burst positivity hits my now slowing down thoughts it as if i am moving forwards into a bright light in the

18597,14_dmt,14,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,what it was like to trip on i primarily enjoy drinking and am never too quick to go out of my way to smoke marijuana . with my friends new fascination
18598,77_dmt,77,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,neck tattoos and tanned gnarly skin . a wise face my shaman face from a time long ago . this then slowly faded back to me present day . my takeaways
18599,38_dmt,38,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,here is where i felt that the ORG from the ashwagandha root contributed to the prolonged nature of the experience . at this point things were familiar again . i saw
18600,30_2c-e,30,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,duration can make it more appealing in some ways as you may not want the long haul of an acid trip for every trip you do . but i think i
18601,92_2c-e,92,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,it might be of use to people who think they going through an emotionally confusing time people trying to break compulsions or addictions or people who have begun to suspect they
18602,38_dmt,38,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,do my best to explain the infinite things i saw and experienced with our limited time felt like it was going fast but also slow the ORG timeline disintegrated and it
18603,27_dmt,27,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,opened my eyes everything else was back to afterthoughts i think the onset was much faster than the to seconds reported as i began experiencing auditory hallucinations before finishing the dose
18604,27_2c-e,27,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,in it almost . at this point more and more hallucinations started to occur fairly rapidly . i looked at a radiohead poster hanging in my closet and it look as
18605,86_dmt,86,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,penis . the first placeholder i urinate afterwards is usually slightly uncomfortable and it passes quickly . if i masturbate twice without urinating the effect is compounded . the ' i
18606,27_dmt,27,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,be . nothing could have been farther from the truth . it was simply a rapid thrust into a standard psychedlic state . general visual hallucinations physical sensations and thought processes
18607,73_dmt,73,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,encounters my body was able to achieve and maintain a vigorous erection during the entire duration of the experience . hopefully that is not too much information for any one but
18608,71_2c-e,71,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,being the waxing onset much more introspective and educational and the second being the stoned slowly falling plateau more relaxed and . note that this switch coincided closely with the arrival
18609,52_dmt,52,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the movie ' and the monster with eyes in his hands from labyrinth ' with long fingers that looked like spider legs danced across my vision and all around me with

18611,35_dmt,35,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,many people can not seem to go unless on much higher doses . this particular time however was a very bad trip . i experienced the furthest amount of separation a
18612,26_dmt,26,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,me and this awareness did indeed seem to ground me to make it difficult to pass through the waiting i remember linear thoughts such as need to let go if i
18613,24_dmt,24,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,quite funny to me and my friends and that helped lighten the mood since i passed out . then i was asked something about the universe and i attempted to draw

18639,66_dmt,66,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. the buzzing grew until it overpowered everything and i began what seemed like a long analysis in my mind of what was happening after about or minutes i felt as
18640,77_dmt,77,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,pig . ha well it just so happens i like being a guinea pig so pass it here ' so he gave me the mirror it was sitting on and told
18641,49_dmt,49,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a hell of alot because right after our respective peak our thoughts began moving very fast . i ca remember all of what we talked about but like shrooms we had
18642,14_dmt,14,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was probably the best and most fulfilling experience i have ever had using drugs . quick background on previous experience been a regular marijuana user since i was about more or
18643,66_dmt,66,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and buzzed with immense energy . i could feel it encompassing me and was ever accelerating . the visuals and buzzing grew in intensity more and more until it was almost
18644,69_dmt,69,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,slight bit of justice it deserves in describing the beauty of it after that i quickly tried to scribble down as many notes as possible which i later compiled into this
18645,22_dmt,22,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,should mean to it kinda goes back to what PERSON PERSON said about mdma the time he took it in the mountains he turned around and look at the mountains because
18646,29_dmt,29,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,woodrose seeds multiple times . i have tripped on salvia . i have used on time . i am sure there is something out there that i have yet to try
18647,69_dmt,69,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,murder site . my journal entry stops here because after that i gained rationality . shortly after seeing the bloody handprints i realized it was just a visual and then my
18648,88_dmt,88,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the miracle drug with waves of sound blitzing my mind occasionally each placeholder with a longer interval between the rings . i am back in d trippy room . walls are
18649,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,trip with light doses a heavier more GPE intense trip . trip can also last longer but not to much longer . doses a little bit more heavier than but nothing
18650,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,number combos to unlock the door until i faintly heard my one friends voice . slowly the voice became louder and i came to . i guess i had my hand
18651,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,was amazing . one line had us feeling great and intensified the trip in a speedy way . when the coke wears off the trip did seem to be as intense
18652,4_dob-dragonfly,4,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,. he said he had some bouncing of his eyes and he said there were periods were everything was sorta blurry . my vision stayed pretty crystal clear . there was
18653,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,of the three times i have dosed but i could definitely see the amount of time your tripping for being dose dependant . this trip was definitely significantly more intense than
18654,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,definitely significantly more intense than my last two experiences and it was intense for a longer amount of time this placeholder as well . i was going to dose at but
18655,-1_dob-dragonfly,-1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,up forcing it a bit because we had been wanting to try it for so long and our plans kept on getting screwed up . we both dosed around . i
18656,34_dob-dragonfly,34,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,bit of a hut for fun DATE DATE DATE DATE DATE . the was very long and for the most part it felt similar to being high on marijuana . we
18657,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,i could enjoy the visuals and the altered state of mind which at this point duration aside seemed very similar to an lsd trip . throughout the night the trip would
18658,35_dob-dragonfly,35,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,. do not drive on this . it is very hard to judge distances reaction time is slowed and it can be extremely confusing at large doses which i will explain
18659,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,i probably want to do it again mostly for the fact that such a big time commitment . and for me it resembled an lsd trip with some of the elements
18660,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,not lsd . a few people thought it could have been ORG because of its duration but the chemist revealed it to be something called bromo dragonfly . my experiences on
18661,1_dob-dragonfly,1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,was having a heart attack off of my experiences are as follows it lasts a long time when it works some people do even feel the effects at all while others
18662,16_dob-dragonfly,16,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,i can feel like i on a smooth trip but the next feel coked or speeded out of my mind with a psychedelic mindset the whole placeholder . the craziest thing
18663,11_dob-dragonfly,11,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,talked with the roommate some more starting to get some visuals . my perception of time is off one minute feels like . watched a few episodes of drawn together .
18664,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,some of the elements removed from lsd tripping that i enjoy the euphoric and fairly quick a generally easy where i can begin to reflect on my trip and the seemingly
18665,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,that some or even all descriptions of on blotter are instead ORG lsd or another long acting compound . early bromo dragon experiences durations and bromo and other bromo later it
18666,66_dob-dragonfly,66,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,a total stirring soup . ' me and palms are sweating heavily our heartbeats are faster and our body temperatures are elevated . the body buzz is exactly like the type
18667,4_dob-dragonfly,4,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,of urination just some strange sounds that resembles laughing and i wonder taking him so long so i ask him are you doing ' he replies ' and i say here
18668,38_dob-dragonfly,38,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,filled with a buzz sleep was impossible in this pm the ORG comedown . this period was so frustrating . visuals and mental effects were slowly wearing off one tiny bit
18669,46_dob-dragonfly,46,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,we came in i experienced the worst sweating of my life . i took a long shower which was a good check ' and very at pm we both reached baseline
18670,50_dob-dragonfly,50,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,sit down to do some work programming as i figure this will take a rather long time to kick in . i smoke a bowl out of my vape this happens
18671,0_dob-dragonfly,0,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,someone spoke to me and she was blue and beautiful something i realised for a long while be anyone else run away anymore you need to run away its all i
18672,5_dob-dragonfly,5,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,put up with it after about an hour or so we move upstairs for the duration of the trip . more silly conversation ensues and i begin to twitch harder and
18673,8_dob-dragonfly,8,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,intensity to strong and the fluctuating feelings of soberness and boredom linger on for too long . this drug seems to work in waves and will continually return you to an

18676,0_doc,0,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,day she would be willing to go on the journey with me but that the time to share these things was just not right . the world is intense and beautiful
18677,4_doc,4,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,call of duty . he also is very artistic and spends a good amount of time drawing . while pacing around the house he would say something like naw seriously i
18678,41_doc,41,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,pupils totally dilated . a psychiatrist walked into the ORG to question my sanity i passed . at around k c j and r all arrived to the ORG to find
18679,13_doc,13,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,of all like it was or for damn near the whole song which is minutes long . the time dilation at this point was absolutely immense i mean literally the clock
18680,0_doc,0,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,regardless she worries a little bit about my health and safety . we had a long overdue discussion . i explained better than i had been able to before why i
18681,2_doc,2,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,moments which i sure that my reptilian encounters happened in . this continued for the duration of the long song and it definitely made for a hazy creepy and profound experience
18682,0_doc,0,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,on my residual psychedelic vibes without her realizing what was going on and as i slowly started transitioning into the second stage of the trip we got into some animated discussions
18683,3_doc,3,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,not quite reached the state where reality was peeling back . also this placeholder the duration and speed of onset were eerily different from previous attempts . it just feels like
18684,13_doc,13,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,ORG . but that is a very minor difference that i bet very few would time dilation is already occuring . both myself and my friend are surprised to learn it
18685,2_doc,2,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,could do anything . i could go on and on about this but placeholder story short after i finally put that guitar down i felt like a billion and i had
18686,4_doc,4,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,lap the whole experience and whenever i got up to go to the bathroom or pace around or something he would follow me so closely that he would be obstructing my
18687,13_doc,13,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,very busy on important studies of my own there little chance i can find the time for your study center . why you give me a business card i collect information
18688,5_dob-dragonfly,5,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,enjoying a very comfortable peace for a few hours . this was probably the best period of the trip for me being very observant of everything we came in contact with
18689,43_doc,43,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,. t nothing much has changed . i going to up the ante one final time . for a final total dose of t my peripheral vision is and flowing nicely
18690,35_doc,35,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,for later . and i should forget limited first test results might be due to quick onset of tolerance after initial dose i do feel very stimulated . there certainly is
18691,47_doc,47,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,just slightly . not in a annoying or way . not enhancing t effects have slowly decreased for the past hour at least . maybe a bit longer . there still
18692,7_doc,7,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,from about one in the morning til six . i was emotionally unmoved and noticeably slower DATE DATE DATE DATE unable to show much interest in anything because i had the
18693,16_doc,16,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,the place in a psychedelic mashup of stuff . rather everything starts out black and slowly a fully coherent image forms every seconds or so . almost like watching a very
18694,60_doc,60,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,successfully taken a shower and gotten myself prepared for work . i did know how long this was going to last but being an experienced traveler i was too worried about
18695,2_doc,2,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,and it would explode like a bomb . but before it did the world would slow down and audio that i was hearing like around me at the placeholder not in
18696,41_doc,41,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,not as intense as before . some swirling going on in my peripherals no pupil dilation . all in all this was beyond a fantastic experiment . visuals lasted at most
18697,43_doc,43,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,point i looked into my bathroom from my bedroom and held my focus for too long . before long the door frame was transforming into some distinctly shapes . effects like
18698,32_doc,32,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,a fantastic lsd so doc is the shit . it clearly lasts a little bit longer than lsd but not by much . it is in fact so similar to lsd
18699,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,eventually we stop because c says he is too drunk . r heads home and shortly after me and j head back to his place . i realize i could probably
18700,13_dob,13,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,this morning i am almost certain . the only thing that quite fit is the duration of the trip . mine seems to be slightly shorter than what i have read
18701,10_dob,10,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,in earlier would overwhelm me and i would be stuck in them for a much longer time maybe hours . i would have to have a completely sober sitter with me
18702,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,scarce . my plan was to leave a note telling my parents that i needed time to cool off and that i was depressed . so i left from my house
18703,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,we parked in a semi empty parking lot and me and my dad had a long conversation about everything from friends to sports to drugs . the parking lot lines were
18704,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,was absolutely amazing . after around hours of tripping i took some valerian root and slowly drifted off to sleep to awake the next morning refreshed and energized . low dose
18705,66_dob,66,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,take hours to come up felt very little during the first two then an increasing speedy buzz manifests . after the comeup my girlfriend who i had given a lesser dose
18706,5_dob,5,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,if i had stayed tuned it might have turned into an . ' then it passed and most of the rest of my trip was uneventful . thought space was altered
18707,19_dob,19,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,state much like the exhaustion one feels after a days work . the decent was slow from about hour by hours i was completely down and could gone to sleep pretty
18708,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,the ingestion of the material . it made for DATE DATE DATE with alot of time to focus and work on personal issues that arose it seemed strangely detached and impersonal
18709,-1_dob,-1,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,of it so i took it too . i did nt feel anything for a long time then all of a sudden i m feeling a distortion of reality and i
18710,38_dob,38,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,in all ORG is complete utter insanity that s organized it lasts a very very long time i was tripping about hours i do nt know if i will do it
18711,7_dob,7,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE DATE DATE before i spent the trip to the beach . overall a chill time not a very visual experience more of a kind of hilarious i did think much
18712,39_dob,39,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,and the grass had a gorgeous color and texture . the body high came on slowly and over the next few hours i was climbing into a state of complete and
18713,16_dob-dragonfly,16,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,of a psychedelic . the closest comparision i find is mg intranasal though this lasted longer than mg would have lasted . since ORG intranasal is a moderately strong good dose
18714,11_dob-dragonfly,11,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,happened several times during the night until before i knew it i looked at the clock and it was . fuck . fuck . fuck . i was covered in sweat
18715,49_dob-dragonfly,49,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,proceeded to try it more times under much better cercumstances and had a much better time though not nearly as enjoyable as shrooms . and even if i wanted to do
18716,38_dob,38,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,to have been ' kind of in a weird way we all noticed that over time ORG made us more emotionally open to others and gave us a weird ability to
18717,35_dob,35,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,bad then what would be the harm in taking another right wrong . wrong the time was now about an hour and a half after the initial dose . i decided
18718,44_dob,44,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,my tongue . horrible taste again but as i said before worth it another minutes passed until the first traces of effects from the first dose were felt . unlike ORG
18719,77_dob,77,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,my facial features such as my nose ears eyes and lips . they were no longer just facial features . they took on a separate existence of their own as if
18720,9_dob,9,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,above my desk and realized the shape towards the top of the box was no longer square but more diamond shaped . i stared at the box to see if i
18721,2_dob,2,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,a man breaking away from his toys in the attic he is crazy . relaxation time is over . this song makes too much sense . i crossed that line of
18722,13_dob,13,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,in a notepad i had on hand . the first note is labelled ' severe time distortion ' . the next page says ' time still distorted ' so that may
18723,31_dob,31,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,page says ' time still distorted ' so that may tell you just how distorted time actually felt . the peak experience felt like it took DATE DATE instead of about
18724,20_dob,20,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,completely removed and was terribly concerned mistake the hits began to kick in very very slowly at around . c and i became very quiet with only the occasional nervous giggle
18725,13_dob,13,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,other day i found these hits on the internet lab tested as ORG . a quick check revealed that these had indeed been available in northern cali in and these were
18726,30_dob,30,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,. he then pulled out a strip and told me that this stuff will last longer than acid . i bought two of them . i had a pm class DATE
18727,32_dob-dragonfly,32,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,that some or even all descriptions of on blotter are instead ORG lsd or another long acting compound . i am a young man living in LOC LOC and have previously
18728,35_dob-dragonfly,35,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,the dose on the blotters i am in LOC though . i have a full time job so finding the time to take this substance was difficult . nevertheless i took
18729,9_dob-dragonfly,9,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,colour shifting and the patterns on my floral carpets trippers delight were also slightly this period was a very slow up ' the visuals gradually got stronger i noticed very obvious
18730,24_dob-dragonfly,24,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,funny i have not laughed as much as i did on this chem for a long time . i was also feeling very content and the main body of the trip
18731,3_dob-dragonfly,3,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was noticing every little thing . when i was in bed time seemed to pass very quickly i was very suprised by this since before this placeholder seemed to be
18732,36_dob-dragonfly,36,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,just cooked myself some dinner no problem even felt quite hungry but felt very full quickly and could nt finish it . drank a beer leffe blonde with dinner . socialising
18733,8_dob-dragonfly,8,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,fun to be on quite gentle and i never got the ' feeling that other long dose drugs seem to give me . amt . next placeholder i will do to
18734,3_dob-dragonfly,3,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,common belief in another person . i do need to recognize this out only a quick the idea that placeholder is really unimportant to everyday living is more sane than the
18735,90_dob-dragonfly,90,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,feel judged for being people . for the record all these feelings were reinforced when time came to dealing with funerals of loved ones as of recent . never dealt with
18736,8_dob-dragonfly,8,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,is better or worse than anyone is . that is irrelevant in context to no time and to love . this drug does lower appetite then again my mom once told
18737,35_dob-dragonfly,35,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,first possible negative effect i have a slight headache although it seems to be fading rapidly . for what should have been a threshold dose this is lasting an awfully long
18738,1_dob-dragonfly,1,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,enhanced flavours but nothing extreme . bp pulse effects are reducing but it is happening slowly . there is still some effect though getting hard to tell i have become more
18739,68_dob-dragonfly,68,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,to me first in the trip i saw and heard that the whole existence is endless by numbers . i saw that there is endless possibilities and endless different lives .
18740,15_dob-dragonfly,15,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,saw that there is endless possibilities and endless different lives . we all would be endless beings in this endless sequence of after that i surfed little bit around the universe
18741,7_dob-dragonfly,7,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,only bromo dragonfly this was DATE DATE DATE with a good friend who has since passed away . the trip report was lost after his passing . the description of events
18742,5_dob-dragonfly,5,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,do i have to go or not . the whole trip can be described as endless debate arguing indecisive thoughts i not sure about anything not sure about my bodily functions
18743,6_dob-dragonfly,6,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,err how many hours twelve fucking hours ' i am quite scared from placeholder to time . i think that for now this has been normal diarrhea with no blood in
18744,41_dob-dragonfly,41,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,of stuff will be coming out of my bowls . the effect is wearing out slowly but still too damn slowly . my pupils some placeholder a go big as plates
18745,30_dob-dragonfly,30,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,takes hours to really kick into full gear . also given how easily it was passed off as acid . i know many people who would easily start the night off
18746,52_dob-dragonfly,52,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,looked and felt but we could just not stop . the movies did not feel long at all almost like a short tv show . d decided to go to bed
18747,52_dob-dragonfly,52,dob-dragonfly,Serotonergic psychedelics,. well i was wrong the trip continued watching movies until we came across and passed the hour period i had been feeling almost like death was right around the corner
18748,8_doc,8,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,sober thought . which brings me to the short summary of the comedown descent really long really slow . the comedown is smoother and transitions slower than almost any drug ever
18749,8_doc,8,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,negative their were doc would probably be right around the middle . a lot of time needs to be freed up and dedicated to the use of this drug because it
18750,13_doc,13,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,simplified and confined to each of our levels of understanding about life . space and time are folded on top of each other and assimilate every sensual aspect of the universe
18751,5_doc,5,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,routes and the people surrounding me is very important . a trip that lasts this long can get very grim when i feel trapped in a certain situation . overdosing mg
18752,6_doc,6,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,puke so i just run to the bathroom . i get there in just enough time to explode all over the sink . so i cleaned that up everything was swirling
18753,2_doc,2,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,. but the sound was really weird and annoying i just wanted a bit of time to myself . so i lay down and close my eyes and press my head
18754,2_doc,2,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,. so i immediately began to change the drum . i was speeding up and slowing down the tempo rearranging it changing lyrics . anything . it was nearly scary .
18755,36_2c-e,36,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,eaten small wood grilled steaks and i was concerned that it might delay the onset time . twenty minutes after we drank the solutions the sun began to descend and the
18756,34_doc,34,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE from the remaining ticket stubs in my pocket . we stopped to smoke a quick bowl of cannabis prior to heading to downtown athens to see a friend perform jazz
18757,16_doc,16,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,his fiancé . it like a condensed therapeutic series of sessions being fired through a time warp via a psychedelic cannon . i am learning so much in so little time
18758,32_doc,32,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,be easily done . the flowing of one thought into another is unbelievable during this long peak . very similar to a hard lsd peak and much more directed defined and
18759,26_doc,26,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,fashion possible . this entire process of thinking and responding happened in about seconds of time and my brain was moving at full speed throughout the short duration . to my
18760,6_doc,6,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,took two hits . we ate our sugar cubes and went on a walk to pass the placeholder . once the doc started to kick in i felt sick . half
18761,0_doc,0,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,to her . i totally forgot she was there . confused as to where the time went the night before i felt terrible i forgot about her . she told me
18762,41_doc,41,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,that were entirely logical . my pupils are beginning to dilate . this is certainly slow and gentle in the oh my goodness . PERSON PERSON is absolutely awesome to watch
18763,16_doc,16,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,psychedelic breeze that allows no room for anything but intensity and awe not even enough time to think about anything more than exactly what in front of me though i ponder
18764,8_doc,8,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,inspired . despite the rather intense first hours which are still amazing it really the long long plateau of the drug that makes it a great one . that the thing
18765,3_doc,3,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,. all that placeholder we were coming up for almost hours at this point very slowly but it was stopping it was really going to give us a nice smack on
18766,8_doc,8,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,this drug . as i walk into my bedroom my jaw drops . frozen in time as i stare at something that almost never interests me when under the influence of
18767,3_doc,3,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,it was over a hundred feet in placeholder from . we decided they use the time and money to put it there if it going to be a good and challenging
18768,32_doc,32,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,experiences are expensive . i was ready to free my mind now and wanted the quick answer . i get hold of lsd so when i was offered doc and read
18769,11_doc,11,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,tested was measured on a recently calibrated balance readability . due to the minimum expected length of the experiment the experiment was started early . the weather was beautiful mindset was
18770,36_doc,36,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,mind . sure it sounds kooky but i was having a blast . but the time had come to nourish myself so i figured i destroy the kitchen with a bag

18774,88_doc,88,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,i had more misgivings than i had not done any sort of hallucinogen in a long while and when i showed up at my friend place he offered my so and
18775,52_doc,52,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,film nightwatch . i felt nothing in particular through the whole movie it took a long time for the doc to take noticeable effect . i did care for the film

18778,44_doc,44,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,then if it is not to bitter i probably hold it in my mouth for quicker absorption . ate two bowls of cereal at just to have some food in my
18779,5_doc,5,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,times i had been sold the dox i have always loved the trip just not duration but i blame it on the fact that in the past i have dosed the

18785,14_doc,14,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,you want to push the oev aspect but smoking cannabis and having a little alone time to go off into the visual world has a good bit of fun to offer
18786,8_doc,8,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,has a good bit of fun to offer . very fun drug but it a long one . for those who like to sleep at night starting in the evening is
18787,16_doc,16,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,by about hrs it would possibly be the best psychedelic i taken but given it duration caution is advised . my fellow agents being present really helped to make this placeholder
18788,11_doc,11,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,half hour mark things started to go real strange but impossible to accurately give the time . difficult to explain but i had arrived somewhere where time no longer existed .
18789,21_doc,21,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,on microscopic i thought i was dreaming . i walked right out of my first period class because i did feel like learning . i thought i was dreaming and wanted

18792,4_doc,4,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,hatchback coup . i squeezed my way out and ran behind him getting inside in time to see him striding through an emergency room full past capacity likely with very sick
18793,4_doc,4,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,. he yelled demanding to see a doctor immediately . security was called and arrived shortly after i had calmed the kid down . he still looked agitated so they simply
18794,4_doc,4,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,felt like something was literally wedging itself between the two halves of his brain and slowly separating them . he kept insisting that he go to the hospital and we kept
18795,35_doc,35,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,single doses . i try some and love it . doc is a beautiful clean speedy euphoric visual trip . loaded at per hit on his first page i take and
18796,43_doc,43,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,architecture had nuances and art built into every stone but i am regaining my vision slowly i still have a heavy body loading and my speech and interpretive skills are slowed
18797,30_doc,30,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,still no sudden realization i tripping balls that i usually get on acid but instead slowly increased throughout DATE DATE yet without me specifically noticing it . this is probably because
18798,50_doc,50,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,little reason . eventually i brought out an oz of heddies i just bought and passed a bong around which helped to relax the general insatiable tweaking urge but nothing much
18799,3_doc,3,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,' in a childish voice . the only thing i can picture of this placeholder period was PERSON popping out the dose for lando . i was in no mind state
18800,16_doc,16,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,takes a while to manifest its self . the classic psychedelics enter the brain much quicker . eventually my perception became more and more clear as me and PERSON had reached
18801,11_doc,11,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,that was mistake number . i get back to the house and have an abnormally fast come up minutes which takes me completely off guard . i shake it off and
18802,88_doc,88,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,hallucinations would be as near as strong as a higher dose . a lot of time for the people who went in the loop they wo really remember what exactly had
18803,35_doc,35,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,also the doc is active as low as mg with threshold effects such as a speedy and low euphoric high with visual distortion . PERSON takes up to hours for full
18804,18_doc,18,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,down and within hours and sleep are completely gone . when snorted the effects were shorter but kicked in faster . it really stings also and yes doc is very bitter
18805,6_doc,6,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,we come prepared for the latter which was reassuring but thankfully the gastrointestinal discomfort was short finally the bodily discomfort subsides giving way to the long and gradual peak of the

18808,14_doc,14,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,at the very worst cluster headaches that will return for DATE with any type of accelerated cardio activity . cannabis adds a to the experience and subtle reactivation of certain hallucinations
18809,6_doc,6,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,even the throwing up which is something i usually hate bad . it lasted pretty long for me but unlike the i took which lasted similarly long i dreaming for it
18810,5_doc,5,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,so much of a body load . it was certainly manageable and during the euphoric period of the trip quite peak begins . we decide to walk around town again .
18811,55_doc,55,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,a nice café feel witty and alert . i am euphoric because there is a long lasting phenethylamine in my body and ORG because i am hurting myself and can not
18812,22_doc,22,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,i slept just a bit perhaps hours and woke up the next morning . before long my boredom and apathy got to me and i began an mdma binge the likes
18813,7_doc,7,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,took of DATE DATE DATE DATE and it was very weak weaker than was DATE time DATE . i had slight visual crawling and increased clarity and mood . this is
18814,5_doc,5,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,to trip outside and i certainly more than used to the walls of my apartment time continues to flow on . the doc has made it slow to a crawl .
18815,41_doc,41,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,afraid . something is i wake up two hours later . did i sleep or pass out i am repairing . my eyes are no longer dilated . the electricity is
18816,30_doc,30,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,to me that doc is like what acid wishes it could be if it were longer but i disagree . i much rather have the natural clean feeling high than this
18817,10_doc,10,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,wee well i know during the next hours some friends first came by for a short time i found it really quite hard to keep a normal conversation with sober people
18818,30_doc,30,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,i ate a lotta acid . a question would be asked and my mind was faster than my mouth could move so i was just everywhere . then they left i
18819,38_doc,38,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,really mostly up in the mind where all the action takes it came on suprisingly fast faster than ORG which i can feel somewhat in the hour but does build up
18820,38_doc,38,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,ORG which i can feel somewhat in the hour but does build up for a long while after that way way faster than doi . after about hours it did seem
18821,31_doc,31,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,on its way down seems like the main plateau was around t then a real slow drop off after that . at t hours i went to sleep fine and woke
18822,7_doc,7,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,phens before this . one with at ORG which kept me up for an extremely long time one with at ORG which was great and DATE DATE DATE before this one
18823,10_doc,10,doc,Serotonergic psychedelics,that the vodka and doc be tasted . immediately after that we went for a quick drive to return the fountain and PERSON to a movie store before we started feeling
18824,38_dob,38,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,to distinguish my thoughts from my perhaps it was the unexpectedness perhaps it was the duration . for whatever reason ORG was an incredibly traumatizing yet eye opening experience . it
18825,43_2c-e,43,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,eyed into darkeness for this same kind of effect that was well now happening very fast with no need for absense of light so i brought a blanket and had my
18826,42_dmt,42,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and chuckle in amazement . i rearrange myself on my bed so i am no longer propped up buy lying completely down . i rethink the experience trying to run through
18827,18_dmt,18,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,in the distance . we placed the powder in a glass pipe and it was passed to me to inhale . and it was disgusting . absolutely foul . i just
18828,96_dmt,96,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,ORG codeine . i crush pills and add to a glass of water and down quickly it no miracle cure but better than this night however the migrane would appear at
18829,42_dmt,42,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and i am reminded of the unhurried rushing that occurs before surgery . i am quickly given instructions where to sit where to lay back to hold it in . i
18830,86_dmt,86,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,drain and i was poured back into my body weeping upon . four minutes had passed . four that ca be right . no way that was only four emerged from
18831,12_dmt,12,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,emotional roller coasters that the mushroom state can draw me into particularly because of the extended time of the trips . same goes for powerful acid trips and other indole i
18832,77_dmt,77,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,face would be if i still had one . they were constantly moving and impossibly fast . an arm here . a face there . over and over . without words
18833,6_dmt,6,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,sick and thought i was going to puke but i dismissed the urge and it quickly left . over matter ' i thought . i looked at my hand and it
18834,26_dmt,26,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the intensity was a predictable never doing this however i knew that such thoughts always pass if i allow them to just pass rather than clinging to them or trying to
18835,25_dmt,25,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i meditate . furthermore i recalled that my first reaction to salvia was similar and passed giving way to something amazing and enlightening i saw no reason for that not to
18836,22_dmt,22,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,with them further put another way i see what all the fuss was about . shortly after completing vipassana i had my first experience with mdma and since then i have
18837,12_dmt,12,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,uncomfortable mushroom trips and bad acid trips so i was excited to trip for a short enough time that if it did go bad it would be over quickly . eventually
18838,58_dmt,58,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to fail the lesson and fail i did over and over . the way to pass the lesson for me is to hold that frozen thought whatever it may be hold

18840,30_dmt,30,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was on the wackiest acid trip ever . this lasted for another minutes during which time i alternated between uncontrollable sobbing and euphoric laughter as i tried to make sense out

18842,13_dob,13,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,though they mathematically straightforward they are impossible to build in the world humans inhabit . time would have to flow in two pause speaker still there speaker huh . i just
18843,4_dob,4,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,was unable to fall asleep . his mind felt aimless . even though hours had passed since he took the dob he still looked around and felt like he was seeing
18844,31_dob,31,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,plateau . soon enough the videos started feeling a little too trivial to waste any time on . i wanted to explore the visual maelstrom now more than ever . i
18845,31_dob,31,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,extremely high one . particularly enjoyable was the angels falls footage where the camera would slowly approach the fall itself and then suddenly there was the edge with nearly a thousand
18846,11_dob,11,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,insubstantial so just tried to start my day as any other hoping that my biological clock would not suffer too much from this blow . right now it is almost four
18847,11_dob,11,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,my phone down and then the exact time i thought it would be click the clock on and the time would change to the next minute . this happened for about
18848,12_dob,12,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,were the sort of up ' feeling that i get from mushrooms with a little speedy jitteriness . this went on for quite a while until someone suggested maybe another drop
18849,4_dob,4,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,. he almost felt like it was a miniature seizure or something . the strangeness passed pretty quick but it freaked him out a at about the five hour point things
18850,2_dob,2,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,like there was a mass of exceedingly complex coded information contained in the music being passed from the artists ' minds to friend said that while it was easy for good
18851,5_dob,5,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,stick with him for the rest of the trip . waves and frequencies and the time domain . as the trip went on he felt the boundaries of his three dimensions
18852,15_dob,15,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,on he felt the boundaries of his three dimensions of space and one dimension of time start to warp . he began to think of a ' or an ' less

18854,4_dob,4,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,there . about minutes later i call him back asking him what s taking so long . i thought it had been at least minutes and he was only a few
18855,20_dob,20,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,per hit . at the end of the experience i took a couple valiums and passed out . DATE DATE after the world was a beautiful place . i had a
18856,5_dob,5,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,was supposed to last an almost unbelievable hours . that is a daunting amount of time to spend tripping but considering that is one of my favorite entheogens and one of
18857,5_dob,5,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,uneasiness . i seemed sort of ' and out of sorts . the trip was slow to develop and i was impatient for it to really get rolling . by hours
18858,5_dob,5,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,it just keeps going and going and going the trip overall was pleasant but the length of it made it hard to focus on the experience . by the end of
18859,24_2c-e,24,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,funny videos were much more pleasant to watch but my attention span was still very short . we finally walked back to my previous friends house . as we were walking
18860,81_dob,81,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,mg seem to be roughly follow the same pattern . at about minutes after dosage time the first alert becomes evident . typically a bit of energy sweaty palms and a

18865,10_dob,10,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,probably too drunk to realize . somehow we got to the freerave parade just in time . it started and everything was going fine i did realize i was high i
18866,0_dob,0,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,girl . i replied begging to know if she was okay and asking her to pass along a million apologies . i learned that this person found at the timmies that
18867,2_dob,2,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,me before fading away again . music also sounded really cool . finally after some period of time it probably was that long the above ' agreed with my boyfriend that
18868,42_dob,42,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,up on a pallet i had made on the floor . an hour or so passed laying my friend wakes up and his stirring jars me out of my trance .
18869,27_dob,27,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,other side of me was convinced that the music derived from my subconscious and the clock was somehow connected to my life . rather than seeing hallucinations occurring around me in
18870,38_dob,38,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,but it was a humbling and incredible experience to reflect on . also before the time of writing this report i had never looked at the page for ORG . i
18871,20_dob,20,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,take anything away from this it just to be careful wait the proper amount of time to come up overdo it and listen to the tips from the person providing the

18877,39_dob,39,dob,Serotonergic psychedelics,try to look as unassuming as possible . the sidewalk extends away from me into infinity . every straight line is blurring and rippling . the trees are mirroring themselves and
