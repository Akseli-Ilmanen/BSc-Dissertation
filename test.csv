2c-c is not what it seems. this is my second time with the substace slightly larger dose than the 1st....this time, only all I can see is dirty chemical in my brain...not like weed or lsd which actually make me feel somewhut euphoric. 

Intense headache is in the way of enjoyment. CEV's which I dont want there cuz there wrong. music is not at all comfortable so i have to turn it off. lights give me a migrane and i just spent 30 min. puking in the toilet (mind you I havent eaten since this morning) I'm very sick with pains from dry heaving. 

I went into the trip excited the first time and was very dissapointed by the head pain....I went into this trip two and a half maybe three hours ago happy, thinking maybe it was my mind set last time but no. I really have a bad headache cuz of this stuff...its not good for me and not a fun hallucinogenic. I want it to wear off now this drug stinks...

Frightening 25i Experience

My friend had purchased two tabs of 25i, and asked if I would want to try some with him. I told him I had heard of several people having negative experiences from the substance, and that these negative effects were increased with an increase of dose. 'Let's just split a tab first.' I said. I cut the tab evenly in half, and at 7:30 pm, we both ceremoniously placed the tabs on our tongues. The effects of 25i did not kick in until about 80-90 minutes after consumption. The effects of 25i did not kick in until about 80-90 minutes after consumption. We both kept the tabs in our mouth the whole time.

As I began to peak, I got the giggles. I felt wired, and uneasy. After an hour or so, the giggles went away, and I started to feel very anxious and still wired. At 12:00am, my friend went home. I was left in my house with my parents. This didn't bother me much, but my negative feelings began to worsen. Things began to 'breathe' as I would stare, and shadows in the corner of the room began to move.

Long story short, I stayed up all night long on my couch, surrounded by lots of pillows and blankets, and my cats as I watched freaks and geeks. Because I had tripped on psychedelics such as LSD, DMT, and mushrooms, I was able to convince myself that the visual hallucinations were unreal, but I noticed that it was far more difficult than it was to do on other psychedelics. 

Around 3:30 am, I began to have a difficult time breathing, I suspect this was an anxiety attack. I could only catch my breath when I would yawn. My nose also began to bleed a little around this time. I tried to remain calm and just ride out the trip. At this time, I was not having many visual hallucinations but my body still felt pretty trippy. 

I finally passed out around 6 am, I woke up with little to no hangover to my surprise. I would advise anyone considering taking this drug to be very cautious with the dose, start out with half a tab. I have read that the results vary greatly even with a person taking the same dose on a different occasion. All I know is that I will never be taking this again!

I had been using E for 3 years exactly. It was my first hit anniversary on Halloween, and I was at a private E party. The best DJs in this part of the country were spinning in my friend's living room that night... I was dressed up as a techno cat and having a blast, when this guy shouts out in my ear... He wanted me to give him a tiger balm massage. Between my brothers I'm always the one bringing the essential tiger balm... it's kinda my job... So I said sure... I gave him a big massage and then he did the same to me... He was so hot looking... wow... I was blown away... He was the only one at the party that I had never met before, and boy was I happy I had met him.

It has been two years since that party and I now live with the man of my life. Each time Halloween comes by we celebrate by popping a few tablets and partying at our already organised party. I believe that without E I never would have lived such a fully emotional filled life... disregard all the nasty things that I hear about the drug, just one look at my man and everything is left behind. I love him, and I love E

4649,16446, I've Tried to Quit,caffeine,Stimulants,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=57612,"








One boring morning I woke up, I drank my normal morning coffee and headed off to school, hoping to get a tiny lift from the tiny amount of caffeine in the gut-wrenching beverage. I arrived at school depressed as usual. My head down, dressed head to toe in black not caring what anybody or anything thought of my dangerous appearance. I slept through the first couple hours of classes then at lunch a good friend approached me with a few pills in her hand. She sat beside me and asked me if I wanted some vivarin. I considered the possibilities, the positive effects, the negative... and skeptically took two pills from her. To be quite honest I was scared of drugs in general, anything at all. But, caffeine wasn’t a drug to me, it was merely something to help me up. It didn’t even 'do' anything, right?

Well, let me tell you I was WRONG. I downed the 200mg pills with a soft drink. I didn’t expect much to happen, but in about 20 minutes a started feeling happy, hyper, euphoric in a way. About 5 minutes after the initial reaction I started to see everything as pretty and interesting, nobody wasn’t my best friend and I didn’t need anybody to survive. I felt completely independent. After lunch I happily skipped to my art class. Everybody was shocked at the fact that I was happy. When we started the project my mind bubbled with creative energy, tiny dots on paper became a spectrum of color, brush strokes turned neon, every line and marking was perfect. When I got home the effects started to wear off, leaving me depressed and apathetic once more. When I got home the effects started to wear off, leaving me depressed and apathetic once more. So, realising that caffeine was the best thing that happened to me all year, I brewed myself a pot of extremely strong coffee. (Now that I think of it, there was probably 400 mg of caffeine in a cup.) I drank the coffee within 30 minutes of arriving home and about 15 minutes later was practically bouncing of the walls. I was more than euphoric; I was the most perfect thing to ever exist. I was god, a dictator of all creation. Everything was neon and beautiful, I could move as fast as my heart desired. Music, life, the world all made perfect sense to me and I felt like I was haplessly in love with everybody. It was as if the world was in perfect insane harmony. Following the raver saying 'Peace Love Unity Respect' it was a sense of complete utopia.

After that episode, I went back to my friend for more 'happiness in a pill' she told me she didn’t have anymore, because everybody else took two or three. I was disappointed and went home, made my 'special coffee'. 

It was winter break and I was quite obviously addicted to this 'harmless' substance.  

Eventually this coffee form wasn’t enough to satisfy me. I began to turn to other kinds. I wanted pure caffeine. After long, boring research, and many sleepless nights on the computer, I found an over the counter drug that was almost all caffeine. I was again, scared of caffeine. Afraid it would be too strong for my already messed up heart. But, I simply couldn’t stand withdrawal (which included, but was not limited to vomiting, stomach cramps, horrible migraines, insomnia, paranoia, hallucinations, tremors, and ringing in the ears.) and eventually crushed up the small pills and snorted a line.

It was at least ten times stronger than anything I've ever felt before. I couldn’t stop moving, my energy was limitless, everything was neon and exciting and my mind was going crazy. Racing illogical thoughts flew around my head. I wanted to jump higher run faster scream louder and dance the night away, which is exactly what I did. Until the euphoria wore off. When this happened, it was quite a crash. I became extremely depressed, bored by everything and irritable. My muscles ached my stomach jumped, everything scared me and I couldn’t stop crying.

At this point, my mother noticed me not eating or sleeping and my severe mood swings. She took me to a clinic to get drug tested. Surprisingly NOTHING showed up. She was confused, and I was off the hook.
I continued to have my daily lines, and the addiction lives to this very day. I've tried to quit a total of 16 times, all failed miserably within 2 weeks. The addiction is vicious.

I tried cocaine for the first time at a party when I was 15. I didn't even know what it was at first. I was drinking and smoking pot at the time and don't even really recall feeling anything from it. After that, I won't say how, but it was continuely (sp) available to me. I did it from morning until around 12:00 am everyday for about a year and a half. I became nearly emaciated from it making me have such a dramatic decrease in appetite. I lost 20 pounds one time during a month period. 

It changed the way I thought after a while. All I thought about was when I was going to get more or where I could get it or how much I was going to do. etc. I stopped caring about myself at all. I started sleeping around a lot, being fearless when it came to any kind of drug, I would try anything to get high somehow at school if I had no cocaine, I never went to school, I stopped talking to anyone who didn't do it or have it, I even came really really close to trading sex for it. 

I turned 16 and I was already a coke head in the 10th grade. Now, even though I'm off it for good, I messed up my credits so bad in school that I had to quit and get my GED, I still think about it every now and then, and if someone offers it, it takes all my will power to say no. I just wanted to put my own experience out there.

9694,671, My Life in the Bush of Sun,heimia salicifolia,Other,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=14897,"








INTRODUCTION

I can't remember how I first became interested in Heimia salicifolia (Sinicuichi). Perhaps it was from Gottleib's (in)famous book, perhaps in was the description in Rick Hepting's catalog of interesting plants. Either way, I decided I wanted to grow it and found an ethnobotanical supplier who carried seeds. Not knowing how utterly small the seeds were I ordered two packs and in a few weeks found myself in possession of hundreds -- if not thousands -- of tiny seeds. I started a flat and patiently awaited their arrival.

And waited.

The mythical mustard of the Bible starts as a tiny seed but grows to huge and epic proportions. Biblical scholars have never really identified what was meant by 'mustard,' but if I can add my opinion, I think it is safe to say that it was *not* Sinicuichi. From these tiny seeds grow very tiny plants, and while my germination rates were high, a month later I still had a flat full of plants that could most accurately be described as 'teenie weenie' (under two millimeters). My patience began to grow thin, and as I misted and tended these precious little bastards I ordered fifty grams of mature, dried leaf from another ethnobotaical purveyor.

The modern archaic revivalist will find that very little information on Sinicuichi is available either in print or on-line, but one point that the scarce resources seem to agree on is that the plant is horribly, disgustingly vile and bitter. Not that I'm against drinking vile liquids (I loved Kool-aid as a child, for example), but I decided to forego the traditional tea and try smoking extracted material. I didn't know much about the quinolizidine alkaloids present in the leaf, so I undertook a series of experimental extraction, each of which was bioassayed for activity. My first series of extractions/experiments is now complete.  

Gather 'round children, and hear what I have to say.

FIRST EXTRACTION

For my first attempt with H. salicifolia I performed an extraction similar to ones I had performed on Nelumbo nucifera. I placed a quantity of dried leaf into a round-bottom flask with 95% ethanol and gently boiled it, as if I were making tea. I had intended to boil for a while, but volume reduced quickly so that the total boiling time was about 10 minutes. I don't know much about the active quinolizidine alkaloids in salicifolia, but as I've read of extracting with boiling water I assumed that the alkaloids are not very fragile, and that boiling in ethanol would produce a powerful and fast extraction.

The first thing one notices is that H. salcifolia has a very pleasant smell. The smell was strong, so there are obviously some fairly volatile components in the leaves. Hopefully the active alkaloids themselves aren't very volatile. If they are, extraction and storage would be problematical.

After boiling, I evaporated the remaining liquid under a fan. I did this for several hours, and the next day a scraped up the sludge and heated in an oven on 'warm' for a half hour or so. This dried the dark green wax and made the material pretty dark. That night I broke the hard wax into small pieces so that they could be smoked more easily.

I decided to try the extraction, so I prepared a tobacco pipe with a screen made from metal foil. I took the extract onto the patio (I don't smoke inside) and smoked all of it. It didn't burn well so this took a while. The smoke was pretty smooth, largely because it was hard to get it to burn (let alone burn vigorously).

The results were subtle and hard to quantify. When I came inside after smoking, the lights in the house seemed bright and my visual acuity seemed heightened, but when I walked around my property in the dark things seemed a little foggy. I observed these visual effects for a while and then decided to lay down, close my eyes, and observe any internal effects closely.

Like the visual effects, the somatic effects were subtle. I could feel slight vibrations in my body, but I think I was just noticing a pre-existing physiological phenomena because of the slightly increased sensory awareness. Also, my thinking was affected slightly in that I was experiencing... well, I can't really describe it.  It was as if I were feeling some 'popping' internally. It was strange, but almost unnoticeable.

It was an interesting experience, but it was not unambiguous; it *could* have been a placebo. I have read that H. salicilofia can be quite intense in extracted form, and I once exchanged messages with someone recently who wanted to find seeds to grow it after his first experience with a 10X; apparently he liked it enough that he wanted to make sure he could get an uninterrupted supply. There could have been a good deal of novelty driving that desire, but nonetheless it points to a strong experience.

'Why was this so subtle?' I wondered. I came up with a few possible explanations. First, there could be a 'reverse tolerance' effect like the one that many people note with Salvia divinorum or MJ.  Repeated smoking may be needed to break down one's tolerance.  Secondly, there are *no published data on ethanol as a solvent for salicifolia extractions.* I was on virgin territory. Undoubtedly people have tried it, but I had not seen anything published on it; all the extractions I had seen were water-based. It is possible that the active alkaloids aren't very soluble in ethanol. Lastly, the tarry material was hard to smoke. I thought I was getting good vaporization: when I held my micro-torch to it it boiled and I got smoke into my lungs. However, when I later removed the foil 'screen' I saw that a large portion of the material in fact had melted and run down into the bowl of the pipe, forming a hard deposit on the side. In essence I have no idea how much of the material was actually burnt/vaporized, but I'm guessing it was only a little.  Maybe a freebase pipe would work (note that I've never seen one of these but in description they seem right).

SECOND EXTRACTION

With the results of the first experiment under my belt, I prepared a more traditional extract (in which the extracted material is deposited back on untreated material to provide a base for burning).  I made a pretty small batch because I was still using ethanol and I didn't really know if it would work.  

In this second test I took some material, crumbled it well, and covered it in ethanol by about three times its volume. I placed this in a jar in the sun, and let it seep all day long. That night I filtered out the solvent, added some raw material, and started evaporating.

By the morning it had become a green sludge, so I allowed to to continue drying all day. I then warmed it in the oven to dry the material as much as possible. I ended up with a sticky, green, gooky mess, but I was determined to try it anyway. I smoked the material in my prepared tobacco pipe. This time the smoke was harsh and hard to swallow. I didn't smoke very much.

Subjectively the experience was similar: A relaxation and 'flowing thoughts.' It was interesting, but again it could have been a placebo effect.

THIRD EXTRACTION

My first two extractions were ethanol-based, and the selectivity of the solvent was poor: I ended up with frothy green foams that eventually dried, but I feel as if I probably smoked more chlorophyl than anything else. Traditionally Sinicuichi is drunk as a tea, so I decided to try a water-based extraction.

I took between five and ten grams of the H. salicifolia and boiled it in water. After about 10 or 20 minutes the water was cloudy-tea brown. This is what I expected (based on what I had read), and it was very much different than the ethanol-based extraction. With the alcohol, the solution was dark green from the chlorophyll. With the water, very little chlorophyll was extracted. I was happy because the water seemed more selective.

I removed the leaf from the water (about 200 ml) and boiled it down to 50 ml. The water was a fairly dark brown at this point, and I transferred it to a ceramic evaporation dish for the rest of the boiling. I turned the heat down a bit and placed the dish back on the burner.

So far, everything was going exactly as I had planned. As I continued to boil the solution, a yellow ring formed as the level dropped.  Unfortunately the heat carbonized this sticky deposit, burning it.  I boiled until there was just a little brown goop in the bottom, but I didn't dare to boil all of the liquid lest I burn the active components.

After cooling, the residue was the color of caramelized sugar (as reported), and it has the consistency of a thick honey or caramel.  It was very sticky and still somewhat liquid. I scraped it up, tore it into pieces, and allowed it to dry for a day. Even after drying the pieces still weren't hard: they had a consistency somewhat like Bit 'o Honey would if you left it on your dashboard on a hot, sunny day.

I was happy with this extraction, but my yield was very low owing to the burnt material and the difficulty scraping it up. Care should be taken when reducing these extracts. On my next extract (described below) I didn't use the shallow-sided evaporation dish.  I used a beaker with vertical sides and didn't have problems with burning.

Smoking this extract was similar to the previous ones, but the effect was a little more pronounced. It still wasn't unambiguously non-placebo, but it *was* stronger. Relaxation, 'fuzziness,' lackadaisical thoughts. A pleasant experience, but I still wasn't getting as far as I wanted. I decided to perform a fourth extraction, one that would be water-based and include leaf material to enhance the burning characteristics.

THE FOURTH EXTRACTION

The technique that I used for the fourth extraction was similar to the third. I took a quantity of H. salicifolia and crumbled it pretty finely (on previous experiments I did not crumble). I placed the material in about 150 ml of water, and boiled for about 20 minutes until the water became dark.

I then filtered the water though a paper towel, and the solution lost its green color and became the color of cloudy, dark tea. I took this filtered solution and carefully boiled it to reduce its volume.

At about 50 ml I transferred it to a smaller beaker with the material for deposit. I used Sinicuichi for deposit at a 12 to one ratio: in other words, I took the 'actives' from 12 units of the herb and deposited in on one unit. This would usually be called a '13X,' but I like to think of it as (approximately) 10X, as I'm sure there were some inefficiencies in my process.

I continued to boil slowly, stirring often to avoid the burning that I'd experienced before. It was a lot of work, but I managed to reduce the volume and avoid burning. When the majority of the water had been boiled off I removed it from the heat, placed in an evaporation dish and heated it in a warm oven for an hour.  

I was left with a tacky, sticky product. 'What the hell,' I thought.  'I'm going to try it anyway.'

It turned out to be pretty easy to smoke, even if it was somewhat harsh. I smoked it in the way that one would smoke Salvia; I held a flame to it while I inhaled to make sure that it burned. I think I smoked two small bowls, but each bowl much have taken ten inhalations to burn completely. This was the strongest experience so far, but even so it was pretty subtle. Again I felt the heavy relaxation and the 'flowing thoughts.' It was a fine experience, but I wasn't sure if it was worth all the trouble!

I was still experiencing subtle effects, but I wasn't ready to give up. So I did two things: First, I purchased a small water pipe of the type used to smoke certain other herbs, and secondly I walked away from it for a few days. The extract was left in a warm greenhouse to dry. The extract did dry out, so each day I crumbled it finer and finer. At the end I was left with a finely crumbled and hard material, but one that felt dry and non-sticky to the touch.

I smoked about six small bowls of the extract.

Yes! Now I was getting somewhere.

It was not psychedelic as reported, but it had definitely moved beyond the placebo. I felt relaxed and mildly euphoric. The somatic effects were more pronounced and included a slight 'buzzing' feeling.  I found that if I sat down at my computer and concentrated the effects diminished somewhat, but if I closed my eyes, relaxed, and lost focus they became stronger. My thoughts again seemed lackadaisical, and I felt I was without motivation. After a while I laid down on the couch and just enjoyed the feeling.

Even though it was definite it was still subtle. For example, I'm not sure if it would have been safe to drive a car or not, but I definitely wouldn't have wanted to 'find out.' I continued in this relaxed, flowing state for the next hour, at which time I went to sleep.

On the positive side there really were no drawbacks. There were no unpleasant feelings (nausea, headache, yellow vision), no hangover the next day (vis a vis alcohol). There was a subtle but definite euphoria, and euphoria is *always* a good thing! On the negative side it was a subtle experience, and between the preparation of the extract and the relatively large number of 'hits' I took (two of three from each bowl) I ended up working pretty hard for this relaxing euphoria. It seems like every herbal smoke is compared to a 'mild cannabis-like high.' I won't do that because I haven't smoked cannabis since I was a kid so I have no idea if that is a apt description, but if I remember correctly this was much milder.

A night or two later I met with Sinicuichi again and smoked the rest of the extract. It produced similar effects (primarily relaxation and a feeling of 'being out of it,' but it was interesting in that I received an unexpected phone call as I was smoking it.  I was able to hold on a conversation, but doing so wasn't very pleasant. This seems to be an ally that prefers to meet with one
alone.

SUMMARY

Placebo or panacea? Or somewhere in between?

While these experiments have only been cursory, I have found Sinicuichi to be active. The effects are nice. The somatic relaxation and vibration were pleasant (and even mildly euphoric once), as were the alterations of thought, provided that I was in a situation where I could relax and 'be with it.' On the one occasion that I tried interacting with someone the Sinicuichi made me feel decidedly anti-social. This is definitely no Ecstasy substitute!

I experienced none of the traditionally reported effects. I suffered no darkening or yellowing of vision; no auditory hallucinations; no remembrance of things past. Also I did not experience any psychedelia as reported by at least one modern explorer. Perhaps it is all a question of dose, and once my plants decide to turn into the full bushes that they are destined to be, perhaps I will start my second series of experiments.

One final note: I mention this for the sake of completeness, even though I am fairly sure it is coincidental. I have reported that there were no adverse side effects (and I belive this to be true), but on both occasions where I felt the effects strongly, the next day I was bothered by 'phantom itches' on my skin. There is no dermatitis or visible allergic reaction, and I *do* think this itching was unrelated to the Sinicuichi, but I would be remiss if I did not mention it.

The beginning. Back in the 70s as a teenager I began my first experiments, experimenting with mushrooms, hash, alcohol, and downers. The experimentation has continued to this day. A chemical toolbox.

11.00am - Parcel arrived containing 1g 4-MMC. My scales were not sensitive enough so had to guess dose. Divided into 4. Halved again into approx 250mg. Split in half and snorted a line each. The pain was extreme. 

Instantly my head felt as though it was going to explode with pressure, my stomach cramped, my vision blurred, bowels began to move, motor functions failed. The pain in my brain was causing nausea. Felt like a sudden surge in blood pressure. Drowsiness followed.

The hangover lasted several days, the brain pain continued for a week.

Re-dosed 125mg 2 hours ago. Again the experience was one of brain pain and increased blood pressure [I presume it is blood pressure].

Results:
Need to have blood pressure checked out, but, nevertheless, the experience did contain moments of enjoyment and the potential of this chemical did break through here and there.

19570,11946, Perhaps the Most “Spiritual” Substance I Have Tried,salvia divinorum,Other,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=19347,"









I have always been the type of person that when I encounter a new state of consciousness that I master it before I can let it go. Some substances that opened these doors I would try countless times until my mind could not tell one trip from the next and at that point I knew its realm had given me all it had to offer. Having devoured most of the earth’s intoxicants with much ferocity at a young age I had pretty much walked away from hallucinogens altogether. Then I was introduced to Salvia. It interested me for one reason only and that was to take a jab at it and know my library of psicodelic dreams in my head are complete. As if some part of me would feel defeated by knowing there was this plant, relatively new to western society that was known to be as mysterious as it was potent.

So I began my research to learn what there was to learn from books and the Internet until I reached the conclusion that I simply must try it and know that I opened the door myself. This time I would be alone and analyze Salvia in all its glory and understanding. No expectations, no warnings, just me and a gram of Salvia D. My one previous experience was amazing and I wanted to revisit that realm of consciousness having only a taste of it from before. The first trip was to be alone, in the dark with soft music playing. I was all to eager to exploit this new realm of consciousness and know its every in and out. It was this eagerness that lead me into a strange disjointed trip. I would take a hit then attempt to get up and do something and in this grew confusion. I quickly learned two things from this trip. First that keeping my eyes closed is absolutely essential when on Salvia as when I opened my eyes reality came back almost instantly. 

The second thing I learned was that regardless of what people say, for me Salvia defiantly does have a tolerance wall. But like opiates I can build off this wall when going into a second, third trip and so on in the same 1-2 hour time frame.  The first few Salvia trips made me very sweaty and clammy. This symptom seemed to go away the more I ingested. The first sensation that salvia brought on was an instant feeling of disassociation. Like my skin wasn’t mine. The next effect was always the formation of static images in my head in conjunction with a feeling that I was being pulled or pushed by some unseen force. This feeling was a bit of an annoyance at first but I quickly learned to accept it as part of the Salvia experience. Many things can spoil a Salvia trip such as television, music or any outside source of input that isn’t pleasurable. The best way to avoid all these was to simply meditate and keep my mind focused in rather then out and make sure there were no back ground noises that I could hear as one's senses are much finer tuned when under the influence of Salvia. After taking about a half dozen Salvia trips and learning exactly what Salvia likes and what she doesn’t I was ready to scramble my brain with a day trip. 

Once alone again I tried to push the envelope on Salvia and reach the next plateau. Like any hallucinogen I think Salvia is best done at night but I wanted to see if lady Salvia would come out and play in broad daylight. She did, but it was very different. My eyes grew heavy and I felt a sort of drunkenness with daytime Salvia. Even when I was walking about my mind was in a daydream that was as real as reality itself. The fact that I could even function in this state brought me to the understanding that one should be very careful about judging their ability to drive after a Salvia trip. After about a dozen day trips placed back to back I grew to understand Salvia. It is so like a magician’s trick here and then gone just as fast. A truly remarkable plant that the ages have forgotten. 

My final conclusion is that Salvia is perhaps the most “spiritual” substance I have ever tried. I believe it has countless benefits to people the least of which is simply opening its arms to let you know it exists. Salvia is without a doubt a female entity as all the stories of “lady salvia” quickly came into perspective when  I first saw her on top of a hill in my mind's dreams. Salvia holds so much power as it offers the intensity of L.S.D or psilosybin but wears off so quickly that one can totally analyze and perceive their ‘tripping” thoughts almost immediately after the trip. This is where its true benefit lies.

19679,7126, 'This..isn't...what....I.. woonntedd...',salvia divinorum,Other,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=96415,"








Background: I have been taking no medications or other drugs except cannabis. 

I had taken Salvia once before and turned into a piece of plastic that was sideways. It was an interesting experience and I wanted to continue exploring this plant. I bought some 10x from a smoke shop.

Setting: A clearing on the lower part of my property, in the woods. I was feeling pretty neutral and a bit excited to try this (relatively) new drug. I was in general pretty cavalier about the whole thing because I was going to take a low dose and I had done it before. ...Not such a good idea!

I had read that Salvia should be respected and can be quite powerful, so I decided to take a low dose. I had read that .03g was a low level dose. I weighed it out, and then just to be safe I only took half the pile. I lit it and took it in one hit. 

Moments later, I started to feel slight effects and was excited. 

Suddenly I found myself standing a few feet to the right and I was crippled. Whoa! Something is very wrong! I can only feel half my body! uuuuhhhhh... It felt very REAL. Not dreamy at all but like my Real body had really been crippled and now was only half there. 

I felt an immense pressure or weight pulling me dowwnnn... it was hard to resist. I was starting to feel like I had gotten more than I wanted by far! I had only been hoping for some threshold effects. 

'Noo... I didn't want this...' I muttered, maybe mentally. 

...you wanted this..... came the whispered reply.

'This..isn't...what....I.. woonntedd...' I murmered as I drooped. The word wonted seemed so strange, almost like it had no meaning.

My dog had walked off into the bushes and now I felt her as a presence that was more human than dog. I felt that there were real presences there with me. I felt as if the whole world was telescoping into this world I had been before on acid or mushrooms, where everything is very different. Difficult to explain. Something like: My thoughts can be heard and create the world around me, Everything is a human, the bird is as smart as a human and is watching me, everything seems to be revolving around me. Reaching out to me. Trying to suck me in, though it seems to have good intentions and that I would enjoy this place. Kind of like a really horny girl trying to seduce me. It's very strange and completely different from our world. Every fundamental rule is broken. I.e. things can exist inside of other things, my body is the same as that dog and its thoughts, everything is imaginary, those kinds of rules. Completely out of this reality.

Everything seemed to be a symbol of what it was in my life. I didn't like that because it was SO different from our world, it was blowing my mind. How could this be possible? 

I felt like I had been tricked. I thought back: I had been told to respect Salvia, yet I had taken an unknown dose, I had been 'that guy'. I viewed my old life like a dock that had taken me to this place, and how 'that guy''s actions had brought me here. I was so foolish!

I was now leaning over halfway. 'It's a little like melting' I said to myself. The world seemed to have been cut in two or reduced to only the bottom half. I realized the leaf I was looking at had been bitten off... oh no... In desperation I looked at another leaf hoping that what I was thinking wasn't true... but it was bitten off too. Everything was bitten off. 

Noo...this can't be true...

I was bitten off.  

At this point I managed to remember that something was going on and stood up to figure it out.

Holy crap, this was the Salvia! This stuff was powerful! 'It's ok, you just took Salvia' I muttered to myself. I was glad to have myself as a trip guide and helpful influence. I couldn't believe that this stuff was sold in smoke shops. Anyone could take it! Holy crap... I continued talking to myself as I wandered back to the outdoor table where my pipe was resting. 

There are some deep levels here! I thought. Good thing I took a low dose!! 

This had been about 5 minutes tops. I still felt pretty profound effects and though my dog had pretty much returned to being a dog, I felt like I was still in this Symbol World. A car drove by and it was a Symbol, of thefear I feel when someone drives by that they will discover my drug use. It was placed there specifically to frighten and mess with me. This world I had (re)discovered was the true world,and showed me how my old regular world was just what I got from my choices. At this point I wanted to go into the woods to help myself recuperate from what was a bit of a mind-rape. I 
set my pipe down and was not satisfied that it was hidden well enough so I moved it, all the while aware of the symbolism of this and how it showed that I was scared. 

I went into the woods and gradually calmed down and regained baseline after about an hour, though for that time I had a feeling like I just wanted to escape and shut off. 

The main things about this experience were the feeling of having too much, the mindfuck of the Symbol World, and the intense and very real physical effects. I want to emphasize that it did not feel like I have some dream body that's being warped in half, but that my real physical body is. It for that reason felt like being crippled because my body thought half of itself was gone and knows that's not something you can survive.  

All in all it was a scary experience and a great teaching experience. I felt like I had received a well-deserved slap on the wrist for being careless with this powerful drug. 

I knew I would never be so careless again. Since then I have been experimenting with SMALL amounts of Salvia and finding it enjoyable. I plan to chew some and see if that is a gentler and more pleasant experience. Basically, the moral here is:

Don't F*ck with Salvia!

Ive tripped hundreds of times and this one time i am about to tell you about was the scariest thing in my life. One day my friend jami and i was going to trip (nothin unusual for us) and we always take at least 5 hits. That day we decieded to take a 10 strip apiece. We ate it at my house and had no plans but to trip, so we started off on foot walkin to this guys house about 3 miles away. It wasnt even a mile down the road the potent acid was kickin in.

My mind started to wonder off and think. We began to walk really fast. we were about half way there and we passed this old school and there were people on the playground they began to yell at us. By that time my mind was at top speed and I was in a scared state of consciouness. The people were really there, but we were too scared to even look their way. i know i was going on a bad one because i started to think about the weed in my pocket i was about to throw it away because i thought forshore the cops were going to stop us (which in reality no cops were going to stop us for no reason.) 
We got to the main road and we had to cross it. damn i didnt even think about that before we left. I was really having trouble talkin and comprehinding at this point. The cars were going by us and all i seen was tracers as far as you can see, thats what made crossing the road so hard (lucky i made it a cross to tell you about it) me and my friend and i made it across the road we looked at each other and said 'we'll talk when we get there' cause we were having to concentrate on everything else that was going on such as cars cause we were still on roads just anything cause when your this high EVERYTHING IS CRAZY.

We start walkin up this hill to get to this guys house. Here is when it starts getting bad I ASKED WERE WE WERE AT AND IVE WALKED UP THIS HILL A MILLION TIMES. but the thing is I hardly ever hung out at the guys house we were going to and hardly never hungout with any of the people either (i should have thought about set and setting before i went up here and put my self into a bad situtation) We get to the guys house and at first it was cool me and my friend put on pink floyd and sat back and looked at everything turn tyedie and swril and spin around. Then before i knew it i was scared as hell for no reason THIS WAS THE SCARIEST THING IN MY LIFE AND FOR NO REASON. I CANT EXPLAIN THE FEAR I FELT.

I began to hear sirens and get extreamly paranoid and the setting was totaly not good ive never chilled at this guys house before and hardly didnt know these people. (my fault for putting my self in this situation) This feeling of never coming down  was so strong i was convinced i was dying and it was the end and the more i thought about what was going on the more the feeling grew. Before long the whole house knew what was going on.i was hiding in the guys room completly terrorfied hearing sirens thinking people were coming to get me.

Then I began to get violent.  I told everybody that they were against me and i hated them and then they tried to calm me down and i then told them that i loved them then it would start back worse than ever. they tried to take me outside to get my mind off of the bad trip but the feeling just keep getting worse i was running away from them in the road and then get a little ways away and run back to them and then when i got back to them i thought it was my enemies again. By then i was screaming out stuff off the top of my head about different girls ive been with, me going to jail (which ive never been at all) thinking my truck was wrecked (which my truck was totaly fine) my hair was sticking straight up it had looked like i had been swimming i was beating up everybody (i had super human strenght) it took 3 guys to hold me back and they were still having a hard time.

I was so scared i called my mom (big mistake) by that time the guys mom and dad at the house knew what was going on cause i was screaming that i was never coming down and all that other crazy stuff i was doing. they got on the phone with my mom and told  her were they lived and got my mom right up there. my mom came though the door and there for a sec i was alright (i guess the trust and safety i felt around her made me feel good) i went and gave her a hug and then i flipped out again and tried to hurt her (i so wish that didnt happen).

They called the cops that instant i had no idea what the hell was going on i just thought it was the end. The cop comes in and i try to attack him he sprays me with Mace and gets me down (i was screaming lets just smoke weed. what the hell was i thinking) the paramedics came in and gave me a shot of thorazine. then off to the hospital.

I kind of remember the ambulance ride not really. i came to in the hospital and this women started asking all the question (i just said i dont know to everything she asked) i was still seeing all the crazy visuals but my mind was back as if i had a good acid trip (thorazine is good stuff) my mom was standing over me and saying you did it this time (i was thinking damn how could this happen to me) i felt like shit cause i flipped out at a guys house i hardly ever hangout with his parents were there. my hospital bill was $2500; an expensive acid trip. they released me and it was as if i was on a good trip i came home and sat down on my bed and smoked a little weed and thought how crazy that shit was.

NOW THIS IS A LESSON YOU CAN TRIP THOUSANDS OF TIMES AND HAVE GOOD ONES BUT THEN YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT COULD GO BAD.

4239,4288,(Teddy) Bear Totem,ayahuasca,Serotonergic psychedelics,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=9762,"







Background: This begins with exerpt from an autobiographical sketch (answering 16 questions if I remember correctly) that I wrote around the time of this trip. I was asked to write the autobiography by the sitter whom I approached to facilitate the LSD/mushroom session described in a separate report. The sitter did this to gain an understanding of my set and context going into the trip, to begin establishing trust/rapport, and to help recommend dosage. The issues I had going in are all predictable stuff. 

Motivation		
Part of me is afraid that I'm not going to have the courage to go through my issues but I deeply want to. I'm scared I'm going to lose it, and I'm not going to recognize myself once I've surrendered and gone through them, like I'm afraid of being fully human. Experiencing false-self death/ego loss is my biggest issue. It's been so important for me to 'grow up and deal' and not cling to my 'stuff.' I¹m nervous about being in a group session because I haven't had that ego-loss healing experience and I don't want to 'show my ass' ...I feel I'm a pragmatic person and the spaces I have just touched upon when I've been high before have made me a little bit afraid but at the same time exhilarated because each time I face my fears a little bit more. I want to have courage and to not be a chicken. At the same time I'm proud of how far I've come and the courage I've had in facing my issues, considering how much anxiety I usually experience. I want to integrate the parts of myself that I unconsciously reject and that thus have a strong unconscious influence on my life. I want to learn how to accept love more. I want to gain clarity in my self-image and identity. Right now I feel out of touch -- who am I? Yet I have a very developed sense of ego, so surely I'll be all right, right? (I tell myself). 

I imagine and expect I could have a classic 'being in the Void' 'losing one's sense of self' 'ego-loss' experience -- and if I don't have that I'll be some kind of failure. ('Performance' is obviously a big deal for my ego) But that's silly because a person gets just what they're supposed to and can handle the things that comes up or else they wouldn't come up. I try and remind myself: 'trust the process' and yet I have doubts because secretly I get paranoid that somehow I'm fooling myself that I'm part of this tribe (i.e. trippers). I just want to be a conduit for the Universe and be in synch and do the right thing. I don't want to be coddled but I also crave the kind of emotional reassurance I didn't get as a child. I'm scared of 'not coming back' and of just losing it and getting stuck 'out there.' I have a deep longing for my 'Spots' (the tense spot in my back, the tense spot in my abdomen, and tenseness in my solar plexus) to experience catharsis and resolution. I feel like they are little whirlpools or black holes of emotional energy that I want to have blasted. At the same time I try to take to heart what the Secret Chief said about accepting your pain and not just desperately wishing it would go away. That in itself has helped me to live more with my back pain. Sometimes I feel like I have a bunch of stuff to just vomit out. I hold my breath a lot and am working on that. I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to go with a process in such a loving and safe context (i.e. with career sitters)... I don't take to these spaces too easily, they are work for me.

So that was my mindset as I went into the next couple of weeks. 

One Saturday in Spring 1999. -- 65 ml ayahuasca, mixed-gender group setting, two sitters, nighttime, excellent music, in the dark (one candle), eyes mostly kept closed. 

At the onset of sensations, about one hour after taking the tea, I told myself that this was not going to be the journey where I would 'go through' my stuff. So then I felt a sense of utter dread, an 'uh-oh!' because I knew I was going to keep it at bay, like it was not the right setting. And this was nearly comical but also painful and annoying because I knew that I still had the medicine in me and I was going to go somewhere anyway, for at least three hours. My bodymind felt like I was at the high point of a giant roller-coaster, just before the plunge.

Within half-hour, it felt like, I was suffused with intense DMT visions. The space I was in was cartoony elf-land, no jungle at all. Very early on, I saw them beckoning me towards a place up and to the left, and I felt they were indicating, in a friendly, taunting way, that if I would just surrender, that all my pain would go away. And I could believe it but I couldn't give myself permission to actually go through with it. I felt that if I did that it would be accompanied by physical release of some sort, which I was not willing to exhibit in a group setting. I also felt a sense of longing as I thought fast-forward to the session I knew I would be having in private 12 days later. Since for where I'm at right now, allowing myself to feel things has been a big issue, I felt that the more private session would be the one where I would give myself permission to 'let it out.' Before I got too intoxicated to walk, I got up to get my teddy bear which was not yet near me. I realized I would want that kind of comfort.

Since I refused to surrender, I instead went through a repeating cycle of self-reproach, only it wasn't as harsh as self-reproach, it was more like realizations and self-knowledge. I questioned whether this path (medicine/'drugs') was my path. [At one point I think I even 'promised the Universe' that if I could only just get through this, I would settle down, do the white-picket-fence thing and never touch drugs again.] I was shown that there are many many ways to get through the difficult stuff (i.e. through other paths like meditation, breathing techniques), and this gave me relief. I thought on the fact that being a sovereign being, feeling fully adult-human (in the good sense of adult), is an awesome responsibility. I wondered whether I would still feel like 'myself' once I reached this fully human state. This lead me to realize that my spots of physical pain are reference points for me, that I've had them and been conscious of them for so long that to not have them might be disorienting. I felt like they were like the rope that keeps the boat moored; the boat has its place where the rope holds it, but the flip side is that the rope is preventing the boat to either drift away or to purposefully sail away. In this journey, I was still questioning my ability to purposefully sail on. 

I felt that the sheer awesomeness and power of being really present and sovereign was almost too much for me to be able to ultimately handle. This was one part of the cycle I was going through, another part was being offered again and again the chance to surrender (in my inner-visual field, it was still to the upper left hand side, like a wormhole or shortcut). These cycles felt like they were accompanied by the very same sequence of gestures and body movements each time (I was sitting in the lotus position during this part of the journey, the movements were: holding my head in my hands, feeling hot like I was going to purge, rubbing my eyes/ears/side of my head, tilting my head to the same side each time, whimpering, a specifil new tic at the right corner of my mouth, leaning to the side as if in resignation). It felt like it had the quality of an obsessive-compulsive's behavior. Not surprising since I've considered I might have had mild OCD during childhood.

Eventually different things started to come through. Whereas the taunting I was feeling was coming from the left side, my attention would sometimes go to the right, where I saw a more forgiving path (this is where I saw that there are many ways to get through the issues I was thinking about). And interspersed I saw/felt childlike elements of my own personality being joyfully paraded in front of me, like a reassurance that all the things that I have put into creating this ego/personality that I identify as my own are good, strong, anchored, and totally OK. [In a paradoxical yet perfectly logical way I needed to be reassured that my ego was great the way it was before I could eventually experience an 'ego-death']

On this right-side forgiving path, I saw representatives from the family of women, and I felt comfortable and grateful with having them as teachers. Whereas the explosive, blasting quality (wormhole!) of the left side vision felt bewildering and scary, this slower, gentler message from the right side felt 'more my speed.' As the medicine began to play itself out, the information I was getting was more about God/Universe and death. And what I was getting is that after death there's nothing. We just die. But the way this information came was exquisitely nuanced and detailed. The message I was experiencing loud and clear is that the energy/love that we give to one another are what create God/Universe and heaven and life, that the preeminent dynamic of Relationship/Participation is what makes us human and is the supreme reason for being. To hold out on Relationship (in the broadest sense of the world) is folly. Maybe since I don't have a religious background this came as no big surprise? The way it was shown was so beautiful and loving. I saw this network of human interaction (like I saw visions of interlocking bodies handing things to one another, gesturing in interlocking ways, etc.) like a cloak around the planet, constantly in motion, well-oiled, irrepressible, tender and true. 

Whenever I would check what might be 'out there' outside of this network, I 'heard,' 'not up there, down here' (as in 'turn your attention back to the network') -- I felt clichés like, 'you're all you've got (but not in a scary negative sense),' 'this is all there is' (i.e. 'there's no secret behind-the-scenes goings-on or conspiracy you're not privy to' -- this was a HUGE revelation), 'there are no surprises' and 'see? there's nothing to be afraid of' (i.e. there really does not exist a big bad monster that's going to pop in and scare you). It felt like this message was communicated over and over again in many ways, in order to show me that it was true. This was alternated by autobiographical messages -- of how my boyfriend G needed to move to [my state] from [his state] because that's an important relationship to us and it's pointless to not develop it (as in 'why wait -- there's no time like the present'). I believe during this phase of the experience that I addressed (but didn't totally resolve) at some core level one of the concerns from the autobigraphical excerpt above -- the terror I've associated with exploring deep inner space.

Another aspect of this phase -- or of the next one, this was in there somewhere -- was visions of ingesting. I saw myself ingesting the tea to learn the plants' message, and I saw myself 'ingesting' images of a person I have had an unconscious fear response about. In ingesting her, I was taking in the message of the archetype she represented for me, and making it a part of myself (rather than feeling that that is an archetype that is outside of myself and thus unattainable.) Since this vision I do not have a fear reaction when I think about her. This phase [of the trip] of 'ingesting' images in order to try and integrate their messages lasted for a while, too.

I have poor vision in my right eye. At one point in the visions I saw my eye socket as a 'treasure chest' to keep stuff in -- as if I sacrificed my eye/eyesight in order to have another kind of gift, kept for safekeeping in place of the eye.

After I learned the reassuring messages for a while (or maybe it was before it, I don't remember), my journey took a definite turn. Instead of resisting and being physically uncomfortable and cycling through gestures and tics, I began to really BREATHE. I got into a breathing that was deep with amazing exhalations. I felt like I was exhaling to four levels beyond what I had ever exhaled before. I linked this in my mind with the tides, and pondered the tides for a while. 'The tides don't stop, the inhalation and exhalation, the in and out of the tides, are circular, like a wheel, not back and forth like a swing on a swingset.'  The visions took on a bit of a non-populated elegant, nighttime landscape twist. Somewhere during this phase, I began to have many new insights into the spiritual dimensions as mapped out by the Enneagram. [I recently began studying the Enneagram and had been listening to Enneagram audio tapes earlier in the day so it was fresh in my mind.] I saw how the Enneagram could be a useful map for me at this time in my life, I was grateful to have it as a mental hook or grid on which to hang the information that I was receiving viscerally via the medicine. 

I linked the wheel of the Enneagram back to the wheel of the breath and tides, and to the network of the human family. It was also something back in 'non-trip' space that could act as an anchor or touchstone for the information that was otherwise so rich and so detailed that I couldn't possibly bring everything back with me to consensual time/space. Someone had mentioned totem animals earlier in the day -- saying the tea could be useful for meeting them -- and I had the [ok, kind of silly] impression that my own teddy bear that was lying on my chest at this point was my totem animal. This made me smile. It was an ego-anchored reassuring thing.

As the medicine wore off, I was tired but my mind was still so busy that I had trouble falling asleep. I felt forgiving of myself the next day (forgiveness was part of the session's lessons), instead of feeling like I had let myself down by not 'completely surrendering' to where the medicine could take me. Just because it could take me on a wild ride didn't mean I had to be swept along with it. This was part of the lessons I can learn that speak to where I am right now.

[Two days after this journey I added this addendum to my autobigraphical sketch (mentioned above): addendum -- this weekend I did 65 ml of the tea in a group setting. I didn't surrender to it, though I deeply want to. At one point I questioned if this was my path, out of fear. But I got some deep loving messages. A major issue was that I was on the brink of full personhood/womanhood and I just needed to step through to the next level. Not be a 'girl' because that phase of my life is ending.]

A major theme of this experience -- ambivalence about 'growing up' or entering a new phase of womanhood -- is continued in the following sessions of 1999. Basically I felt ill-equipped to move on, hurling towards 30 but feeling like a kid, and reluctant to give up youthful traits, preferring maybe to hold on to them past the point of it being healthy. But images I saw during this trip paraded before me the very things I was worried about giving up (i.e. youth culture stuff, images of cutesy stuff, represented by my 'totem animal', the teddy bear), and celebrated them as a firm foundation for my ongoing growth and maturation. This allowed me to move on without feeling I was losing something forever. It was a really cool, confidence-building thing to witness. 

--------------------------------
This (eventually) reassuring trip was a good springboard for a 'oh shit I think I'm going to go crazy or die' session twelve days later (see the LSD/mushroom combo).

*Cough Cough Cough*

I decided to smoke pot after my friend asked me to smoke with him, I had just turned fifteen. Him and I had known each other since grade three so we went back quite a ways. We had both warred with and against each other over those years but that was behind us. For the sake of anonymity he will be known as his Zim. Zim and I started hanging out after being asked to leave the same christian school. Neither of us are or ever were 'bad people' as the school put it. We were simply two people who didn't follow the same moral compass as others. We are both artists and free spirits which makes us a minority amongst most human beings let alone religious ones. Smoking pot was something he had picked up with one of his friends and I had always heard that it expanded your creative potential so I thought why the hell not?

I remember the conversations we would have about pot and it's effects, how to take a hit and many other subjects. That really made the experience go a lot smoother than other first timers I had seen. The first time he told me he smoked though I didn't know what to think. We were watching a movie and he spoke up.

'You ever smoked pot man?'
'No...why?'
'You should man, it's pretty chill.'
'How would you know?'
'How do you think?'

I looked at him like he had just showed me a mutated kitten, with a mix of interest and humour. After that awkward moment we continued to watch our movie. A few weeks later I asked him if I could smoke pot with him. He looked me up and down like a piece of meat with a mocking sense of superiority and asked me if I was serious.

'Yes.'
'You sure?'
'Yes.'
'Alright man, let's do it! This is so cool!'

I was a little amused at his excitement but I figured it was a good thing. That night I watched eagerly as Zim showed me how to roll joints. He wasn't very good at it back then but I was sure impressed. It was a warm September night but not warm enough to go without jackets. We walked for a while before we decided to smoke, the air was crisp and clean and the streets were empty. The light pollution was at minimum that night so we walked under a rarely seen ceiling of stars. I can remember going through smoking the joint in my head over and over. I remember thinking about taking it in my hands and how I would hold it, then lifting it to my lips slowly and taking a long pull and breathing it out like an actor in a movie would if he was playing a gangster. I was nervous but I wouldn't back down, this was something I felt I needed to do. I believe in experiencing life at it's fullest and I was sick of missing out.

We arrived at the local school, obviously Zim's favourite smoke pit at the time. I remember walking behind the school is anxious anticipation. Zim took the joint out and offered me first hit, I told him to go ahead. It wasn't until a few hits had gone by before I decided to take the hit. I took the joint in my hands and my heart started to pound in my chest, I could barely grip the joint I was so nervous. I moved the shaking joint to my mouth until I could feel the paper on my lips and smell the smoke billowing in front of my eyes. I pulled hard, eyes closed and pulled some more. I had taken way to big a hit way to fast, in short, I coughed like a little bitch.

*Cough Cough Cough*
'Oh my god man you took such a fat hit!' teased Zim.
*Cough Cough Cough*
Red Hat's laughter echoed through my head.
*Cough Cough Cough*
'Dude, are you OK? he asked through giggles.
I managed let out a messy 'Fuck you!' between coughs.
More laughing. More coughing.

After a few minutes I stopped coughing and looked my friend in the eyes, and with supernatural determination asked for another hit. After the joint was gone and my throat was as raw as hillbillies steak we decided to sit on the swings for a while. Zim was messed up, looking at the stars and swinging from side to side hypnotically. I was not high, I was uncomfortable from the feeling in my throat and the taste in my mouth. It tasted like sand from my old sandbox, the one the neighbors cat always shat in. At that point I was not impressed, in fact I was a little mad.

'Dude, how long until I get high?'
'Why? Are you not high?' asked Zim groggily.
'I don't think so.'
'Wait a while.'
'Dude, it's been twenty minutes, you're fucked.'
'Well, I don't think you'll get high then. You'll have to wait until next time man.'
'Seriously man? that is weak!'
'Sorry man, that's just how it goes. I'm high and your not high, sucks to be you.' laughed Zim.

I decided that I wanted to walk around for a while and see what happened. In short, I didn't get high. We ended up walking around the neighborhood while Zim laughed to himself and I anticipated my next joint. That weekend I smoked again. This time with my cousin who will be called Gir. We also smoked with two of our friends who will now be known as Tak and Dib. We went to Tak's house to smoke because she lived by Gir and Dib. I was finally going to get high and I was confident this time. I thought about what had happened the first time and I decided not to let it get to me. I wasn't embarrassed in front of Zim, we had been friends too long, but I was worried what my cousin and our friends would think if I messed this up, they had all been smoking much longer than me and they had grown up in the 'Canadian Ghetto' if you want to call it that. Out there if you showed weakness you got eaten alive. Luckily my fears were just that, illogical fears.

We arrived at Tak's house around nine I believe. Tak came to the door and led us inside her simple home. We were in a complex of housing that Gir had lived in his whole life and Tak and Dib had recently moved into. Tak's house was small but cozy, it had worn out carpets and old broken in couches around a huge TV. The pots and pans were piled up next to each other around the sink. It was a big difference from my comfortable life style but I had seen worse so I embraced it. We sat around for a while and watched the tube until my cousin finally asked me if I wanted to smoke. I eagerly accepted and we went up to Tak's room. Tak's room was empty but for a frame-less bed, an immaculate old mirror and a cork board. The cork board had a piece of paper that Tak pointed to.

'This is my menu.' she said.
'Your menu? For what?' I asked innocently
'Lot's of things, booze mostly, weed and shrooms too.' Tak replied proudly.
After looking at the paper I realized that a menu was a perfect explanation. On the left side of the page were all of the various narcotics and alcohol she could acquire with a coinciding price on the right side of the page.
'Cool!' exclaimed Gir and Dib.

Gir proceeded to approach the menu in a comical fashion and pretend to be a high class businessman selecting fine wines. We ended up buying a forty bag and waited anxiously while Tak rolled some joints. This time the nervous thoughts and shakes were gone. I was completely comfortable surrounded by my friends and my cousin. Then I thought about coughing and I decided that if I coughed then I coughed. There was no way around it, I had seen the way the stoners smoked and I figured it would take a while.

'Done.' chimed in Tak, popping my thought bubble.
'Alright let's smoke this shit Nigga!' shouted Gir.
'Yeah man!' exclaimed Dib.
'OK.' I said timidly.

Tak took first hit as it was her house and her roll job. She lifted the joint to her mouth ever so delicately and took a drag. She kept going, like some kind of machine, some kind of gorgeously deceptive, pot smoking beast! I felt intimidated all of the sudden but decided it didn't matter. After the joint went to Gir and Dib it came to me. I held it hesitantly and then decided to just go for it. I took the joint to my lips and pulled hard, this time though, no coughing. Nothing. Not a peep. I held the hit and let it drift out of my mouth, slowly, watching the smoke create small wisps in front of my eyes, swirl and float towards the ceiling, I still didn't like the taste though. The joint came around again and I took another drag, held it, released and passed it on. 

Again I got the joint but as the joint was passed to me it slowed down, everything slowed down. It was like being caught in a gelatinous blob of the smoothest jello ever made. I watched every cinder float off the joint as it was passed to me and the glow of the lit joint made me feel warm. It felt comfortable in my hand, like I had been doing this my whole life. I slowly raised it to my smiling lips and took a small hit this time, letting the smoke run under my tongue and through my teeth, tasting the bud and loving it until it finally went into my lungs. I let it fill me like a balloon and then I released it slowly, releasing with it all of my stress. I began to view myself, seeing life as if watching a movie. I could see myself and my friends on the bed and then everything would fade into the smoke lingering in the room. I would come back from my trance and see Gir and Dib laughing as they sang old school rap songs. I looked over at Tak and noticed that she was just enjoying watching us. It was surreal beyond anything that has ever happened to me. Like being suspended in a warm fluid environment. Like becoming something other than another body taking up space. It's as if I had all of the answers to all of the questions in my head.

All of the sudden I was falling, falling backwards into something, into some unknown universe or dimension. My head landed comfortably enough and as I looked up I realized the terrible mistake I had made. I had fallen right into Tak's lap. I know it sounds over dramatic saying it was a terrible mistake but Tak is scary. She's scary to anybody who fears for their own life and at that point I was afraid. Dib and Gir went completely silent as I looked up at Tak. It was as if time had stood still. It started quite harshly as Tak swatted me in the head and off her lap. We had a laugh as I apologized over and over again and then resumed chilling. Tak's mom entered the room shortly after and laughed at us all and called us stoners. That's all I really remember of that night.

I was pretty embarrassed but Dib and Gir only gave me grief for a second or to and I think Tak understood what had happened. It was the most intoxicated state I have ever been in. I have been smoking pot ever since but haven't been able to attain such a state again. In some ways I don't care, I have leveled out and developed a tolerance to pot in the sense that I don't become an idiot when I smoke. I am always the one just chilling, philosophizing and enjoying life. I've really learned that smoking pot doesn't have to be about secret outings and shady deals. It can be about spending time with and connecting with my fellow human beings. Just enjoy the love and peace that I get while smoking pot with my friends and that's all I will ever need to do.

I don't smoke everyday but close to it, I know my limits and always smoke with moderations, preferring the ability to think and remember the night to getting completely fucked. I have done shrooms and hash on multiple other occasions but pot is my drug of choice, it really has made my life better and made me a more controlled and accepting person. I live in Vancouver city and growing pot is out largest industry in our province. It has been estimated that if the pot grown in BC was taxed that the profit would be upwards of two billion dollars. Almost a third of the people here smoke pot which really surprised me. Start watching for stoners and you might be surprised how many people smoke around you.

This isn't going to be a detailed report of my first jump with the substance, but rather a short summary, as I didn't find the experience to be too memorable or really worth too much mention.

Dose : 125mg dissolved in cranberry juice

The taste was kind of putrid, but manageable and thankfully it had no aftertaste.

The comeup seemed kind of familiar- the elevated hear rate, the anxiety, the slowly shifting perceptions of reality etc... though it was never overpowering or troubling.

The high itself was pretty relaxed, like a low dose of poppy tea. I sensed no real tactile or auditory enhancements. Just in an altered and relaxed headspace. Mouth was dry throughout and was very bored for the duration, though there never came a time when I wished it would just go away.

It seems like a pleasant way to spend an evening indoors if I just want to be at peace and relax, but I don't see any other uses for it, and at its price, I may as well just smoke some cannabis.

Overall I give it a 4/10. Will try a higher dose in the future.

It also should be be noted that I had dosed 15mg of Mirtazapine the night before to go to sleep and was still experiencing the sluggish hangover that comes with it.

7348,3113,...But I Did Everything Right!,diphenhydramine,Depressant / sedatives,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=49192,"








Similar to most of the other diphenhydramine experiences here, I was bored, drug-less, and wanted to 'trip out'. I had previously had plenty of experience with altered mindsets (marijuana, alcohol, painkillers abuse, valium, meth, shrooms, morning glory seeds, opium, etc etc.) 

However, the combination of a chime-alarm system keeping me from sneaking out at night for drug hook ups and confiscated weed by the parents put me in a very sober position! Anyway, I have lots of stupid friends and too much free time to read about cheap ways to get stoned, so I knew everything about all that OTC crap. CCCs, diphenhydrmaine (Benedrylï¿½), Dramamine ï¿½, dxm (robotripping) and I was finally desperate enough to try it. 

I bought a box of some generic sleep aid from the local pharmacy and remembered to check that it was diphenhydramine HCIï¿½ no acetaminophen or pseudoephedrine type chemical. I went home, set out 8 pills (each 25 mg.) for a total of 200 mg. This seemed like a good test-run dose being a 120 pound teenage female. I started to notice the trip about an hour after ingestion and felt pretty neutral. I was very tired and felt too dizzy to sit up, so I went to lie down in my bed. My legs felt insanely restless; I constantly had to shake or stretch them out, or I would feel so tense in the rest of my body. I started having lucid dreamlike thoughts, where I would completely forget I had been staring at something and snap back into reality. 

At one point, I was staring straight into the eyes of a very old woman who was getting her hair done at a salon. She just kept staring me straight in my eyes, and I asked my friend sitting next to me, 'Is it rude to keep staring?' After I had spoken aloud for the first time during any of these trips, I snapped back into reality and realized that I had been staring at jeans and talking to absolutely no one. 

I started to get freaked out by how real all of the trips were. This was nothing like acid, where I felt such intense euphoria and love for emotions that I could taste and hear in the form of music. There's nothing trippy or profound about diphenhydramine. Its more like ï¿½Hi, wanna experience the biggest W.T.F. of your life?ï¿½ At least with acid or shrooms when a trip is outrageous, you say to yourself (or friends) man this is amazzzzing. With diphenhydramine I was just in this horribly sedated, uncomfortable zone and I didn't even know it!! 

So, naturally, I decided to try it again the next weekend. But this time, it would be better because I would do more pills, or I would have better music, or a trip sitter, or something. I just knew it could be better. (Although I never ended up having a sitter.) 

This time, I downed 18 pills for a total of 450 mg. I assumed that since it was still 50 mg below the LD-50 that I would be perfectly fine. I assumed that because I had an 80 pound friend who could handle 1200 mg and 3 shots of vodka, that I would be fine. I assumed that because 18 was only 10 more than 8 that I would be perfectly, completely fine. Although it could be argued that you can't 'responsibly' abuse OTC drugs, I felt that I was pretty damn responsible about it. I read everything I could get my hands on before, I measured out seemingly perfect dosagesï¿½ what happened should NOT have happened. 

I barely even remember anything from that night, but I remember going to the bathroom 10 minutes after ingestion and feeling as if I were in a padded box and there were dozens of hands pulling at my hair, but that I didn't really care. Then, I became very paranoid and quickly stood up and looked across my room to see a perfectly normal shadow. The shadow started to move and turn into a figure that wanted to hurt me. I quickly just bolted out of my room and across the hallway into my brother's room (He was playing video games and even in this delirious state, I thought that I'd feel safer around him, even though he was only 13 at the time and not up on my drug usage). I was sitting on his bed and I remember rocking a lot. 

After that, the first thing I remember (that I haven't been retold by my brother, doctors, or parents) is having these large faceless/figureless blobs prick me with needles and asking me questions; they kept telling me that I was doing great and to keep on swallowing. That's all I remember until the morning after when I woke up really disoriented. 

That day I found out that the previous night, I passed out, started having seizures, and going into hyperthermia. My little brother yelled for my parents, and they called 911. The EMTs rushed me to an emergency room, where I managed to swallow 8 oz. of charcoal but then vomited so they had to pump my stomach. I was also put into this ice bath to lower my body temperature. Apparently I had a conversation with the hospital psychiatrist and social workers, asking me why I did this and other questions but I couldn't have been more incoherent so they assumed I was basically crazy. The hospital would not release me until they felt I was better, so I stayed inpatient for a gruesome 4 days. 

To be released, part of the deal was that I had to go to a 14-day inpatient rehab program and a 12-week outpatient drug and alcohol program. Aside from that, a lot of psychological problems resulted from the diphenhydramine overdose. I'm extremely paranoid in my house and I have all these conflicted subconscious issues that I can't deal with because I don't remember that night (Such as, only in my room-- I started getting anxiety attacks if I look at anything too long because it morphs and distorts, and the shadow on the door still freaks me out. My head starts to hurt if I stare at the tiles in my bathroom too long. Basically anything that my subconscious associates with that night, I can't deal with.) 

The whole process just sucks. Please, please take into account your SELF. Everyone really does react to drugs differently. Weight distribution might not always be a sure-fire thing to go by. If you're thinking about using OTC drugs to get high, just don't. I'm one of hundreds of kids that had really lighthearted intentions, but now (as a result) getting pee-tested every couple of days, therapy, etc...its not at ALL lighthearted. It bugs me all the time that I can't even remember the night that has shaped so much of my current life and time. It seems like I'm always either at therapy or at required drug & alcohol program, and one night of dissacosiative tripping was NOT worth 6 months of all this. 
---Peace and Love.---

Heroin... Be The Death Of Me... 'Lou Reed'

I can certainly relate. I've been an 'on again off again' Heroin abuser for about four years. I am now 21 and for the hundreth time I've decided I've had enough. No More Dope. Period. 

Yeah Right.

The joys of Heroin are so simple yet so complex. Without Dope I often feel I cannot accept the world for what it is. When sober, I hate everyone and everything. A simple 'Hello' in the morning from  friends or family will be returned with a grunt and dour face. When speaking, the only words coming out of my mouth will be pure negativity. Towards everyone and everything. Any small distubance at work or play will result in a verbal bashing. I will have no motivation. It is impossible for me to be happy about anything while sober. ANYTHING.

When I am High... Everything is PERFECT. I have the motivation it takes to be commended at work for pushing myself to my physical limit and getting each and every job finished with speed and precision. I will be able to carry on a normal conversation without becoming annoyed by other peoples personal opinions. I can accept the fact that the world is crooked... that our actions are being dictated by another entity. When High, 'I CAN AND WILL'.

But that only lasts for so long. After about three months, I start getting paranoid. I start feeling guilty. I start worrying about my health. I start wearing long sleeve shirts in 90 degree weather. I start wondering if maybe I can feel 'normal' without Heroin. 

And so starts my millionth stab at sobriety... Methadone to silence the scream of the dying monkey. A new outlook on life. 'I can do it... I know I can'. I think, 'I haven't felt this good in ages'. and everything is kosher for about a week. Then I come full circle. 

It's strange. So many people claim Heroin makes you not want to feel. Heroin fills me with emotion. The first couple months I appear as a normal human being with a normal mindset. I have my shit together when I am using daily. Always. When I get clean is when things start to fall apart. I cannot deal with people when I am clean. Heroin gives me patience. Heroin gives me motivation. Heroin gives me the strength to carry on. That is until it gets to the point where I need so much to get high my wallet starts breeding moths. Get High? What am I talking about?... I should call it 'Getting Normal'

I wonder if I will ever be able to quit for good. 
Probably not.
The monkey only hibernates. And when it wakes up... its always hungrier than it was the last time around.

... Heroin: Its my LIFE and its my Wife ...

16084,3601,.3 PPM of Our Air,nitrous oxide,Dissociative psychedelics,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=16291,"








I used nitrous when I was about 15, for several months, because it was the only drug I was cool enough to get my hands on.  I thought it was amazing then, but was scared off by reports of oxygen deprivation and had only done it once, whisking an LSD trip into the far-space for the first time in my life.  Since discovering salvia, mushrooms, the mescaline cacti and many other amazing and useful tools are legal and readily available, I decided to reinvestigate those things our crooked laws WILL allow me in the exploration of the cosmic unconscious.  I recently read up on nitrous enough to allay my fears, and embarked on an adventure that has been refreshing.

The problem I always have when I try to talk about my experiences inside is that, no matter how adequately I describe my visual content, my state of mind, my insights even, there is some central point, something else that's going on apart from my interactions with the others, that I am incapable of capturing.  I used to call it 'the thing about acid I can never quite remember.'  It's some little learned skill, some thing I do with my third eye, that acts as an invitation which the universe immediately answers... To take it a level deeper... To notice another connection between things and have the connection be as real as the things... And it's connected to the breath, unhooking the breath and relaxing enough to notice it instead of trying to notice it... Like I'm calming down enough to pay attention to the wisdom that's always already built in, getting closer to understanding the point... To grasping the plot... It's just so hard to describe, but I feel it when you do it, and it's how I move off baseline, how I just AM if I take salvia or dimitri or something... If you know what I'm talking about, um, hi, nice to see you again, I love you, you're doing great; if not, don't assume I'm crazy, it's belittling and hinders us both.

Anyway, nitrous comes back to me at a wonderful time in my life.  I've been travelling all year and reached a new level of integration of all that I've learned in the midst of having an amazing, life-altering string of adventures.  My happy switch is permanently flipped and I feel very good about my life, my friends, my development, and what lies ahead.  I just returned from the gathering, made and remade many amazing friends, and was introduced to potent salvia extracts, which are the most awesome, challenging and beautiful experience I can imagine.  

I used the first nitrous containers alone, after 1 small bowl kind, lying on the grass on a warm day.  As I did the first one, I felt the pull to remember before the balloon was half-inhaled, felt myself inflating with spiritual energy to take another run at it. I bobbled my balloon and laid back, focusing on the 'train sound' feeling tones, picking them apart and putting them back together, until I felt myself pulling fast, the 'death' feeling, towards that higher self.  I opened my eyes out of concern (when I have no eyes to open, I get a little bit of the fear... Like maybe I really have died, no way of knowing at first...) And was very gently set down, laughing, in my body.  I did several more, each time remembering a little better what I was trying to do there, how the process works every time, until it reached a point where I was doing it automatically for short bursts, getting much farther than I usually do even off shrooms.

Later, I took the box over to my friends' studio and reintroduced them, to their delight.  MY delight was that I'm getting better at riding the freebie - when I'm physically close to other psychonauts, I turn on, even if I'm sober.  Whee!  (you can do it too, you just have to stop being cynical)  it feels like I can sort of see it out of the corner of my eye all the time, and if music catches me just right I can do it for a second, whatever it is I do, that little flick of the third eye over to the real-ness of what I'm observing... Etc... Is that tracers?  I think that's tracers...

My abiding impression is that this compound is the spiritual water, the prana, the good air of our universe... We have H2O for our bodies and N2O for our spirits.  If I focus during nitrous, I can ride it for several minutes and remember it for minutes after that.  Without an oxy-controlled gas mask, I won't be able to reach the outer limits, but I can go quite a ways, and it's very lucid in my experience.  The potential for abuse, especially among really enthusiastic psychonauts, is enormous.  It's over too soon and doing 'trip breath' correctly doesn't just feel great, it's amazing; my desire to go back straight-away is intense, and setting a 4-per-day limit is wise.

The effect of nitrous during a strong trip on another substance will definitely be of primary interest for the forseeable future.  I believe I could have your trip sitter give me a balloon of nitrous if I knew to expect it beforehand, even under salvia, and the results could be stellar.  Nitrous is a great reminder, a 'reality check,' and in that capacity is good for me, a valuable vitamin in our war against the robots :P   just don't lose your head!

Ecstasy

Turning round I see, surprised,
a large, round, living temple.
I am here, part of it all,
I am part of it all.
I look at the world
and the world looks back at me.
I am not alone.
This is Ecstasy.

Standing, I feel. So tender
and being held so tenderly.
My sadness is like a soft bud
velvet and moist,
my tear a dew drop
trembling on the tip of my nose.
I am so happy to feel.
This is Ecstasy

We sing, we laugh, we share
and most of all, we care.
We let each other see
the beauty inside
without shame or anxiety.
We're happy and free.
This is Ecstasy.

20417,37935,__HOLY__ shit,salvia divinorum,Other,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=17246,"









i have been curious about Salvia divinorum for a long time, and tried it sublingually once but didn't break through.  i was worried that i might be a hardhead, so when my buddy told me he had some salvia and wanted someone to act as a sitter for him, i took a train to his place as soon as i could.
We went into his room, weighed a .25 gram pile of the 5x extract for each of us, and flipped a coin to see who went first.  i lost (won?) so my buddy went first.  Once he was back to this plane, i put on Trane's 'A Love Supreme' and sat on the bed to (hopefully) be introduced to the plant/goddess.

i got the first hit of harsh smoke down fine, as deep as i could, and held for as close to 30 seconds as i could perceive.  As i exhaled, i looked over at my friend and noticed he had sort of a halo of light around him.  Unnerved by the fast comeup i almost stopped, but then decided against it.  i took the second hit, and space started to shift disturbingly around me.  Three-dimensional objects turned flat, but two-dimensional objects seemed to grow and twist at impossible angles and become three-dimensional.  i perceived that i was on the bank of a river in a desert of some kind, the sun was out and it was incredibly hot (i sweated a lot during this).  i tried to take a third hit, and suddenly felt a presence to my right telling me not to.  It felt sort of crocodile-ish, but definitely wasn't a crocodile.  i can't describe it.  But the way it was telling me not to was not the kind of way you'd tell someone not to run into the street blindfolded, it was more of a jealous thing.  Like it didn't want me to be able to see what Salvia had to show me because it wanted it for itself or something.  It was very insistent.  

i tried to take the hit, but i couldn't operate the lighter anymore anyway.  i think my friend took the pipe and lighter at this point.  i fell down on his bed, lost in Salvia space.  The visual end of the trip sort of fell off quickly, but i got spatial hallucinations for minutes after the peak.  Sort of like i could see an object from two or three perspectives simultaneously.

A couple minutes later, i thought i was pretty much down so i sat up and tried to talk to my friend, but couldn't get words to form.  i gestured incomprehensibly and after a while got out 'the cd, first track, cd' or something close enough to it that my friend picked it up and obliged.
After that things fell off pretty fast.  We sat and talked about the experiences for a while, then i went home.

Do not be fooled by its availability.  Salvia is very serious, and incredibly useful.  i plan to experiment deeply with her.

11502,25126,"1 Blotter, 2 Nutters and a Telephone Call",lsd,Serotonergic psychedelics,https://erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=1590,"







I have had acid a number of times before, and since, this night but this was probably the most intense experience. I was between 16 and 18 years of age and already experienced in taking acid. 

A few friends and myself had procured some acid from a friend of a friend. They were delivered to us by the friend with the notion that they were 'double dip' and would therefore cost more (around £4.50 rather than £3), however I was told that they would not be double the strength but still stronger than a single dose. As it turned out I have had 3 1/2 blotters and not tripped out to this degree.

One of my friend’s parents were going away for the night so him and his sister threw a party.  Myself and a few other friends took the acid in a nearby house and then headed over to the party straight away. Now I’ve had acid that has taken 3 hours to come up, but normally it takes an hour or two. However this time it felt as if we were coming up on the walk round, which was only 10 minutes at the most.

We arrived at the house to find that the Parents had not yet left. We were invited in and handed drinks. The father of the house was sitting watching a chess tournament on tv. By this time I was definitely feeling the effects and struggling to hold on. Glances at the rest of the group confirmed that they were feeling the same. My friend’s father started talking us through the game explaining how the two players had played each other fifteen years before and had replicated the first ten moves of that match in some kind of elaborate mind game. This was just a bit more than I could stand. After a while (god knows how long, I certainly don’t) the parents left and the night progressed. The party filled up and became very hectic. 

It’s a haze now but I remember laughing constantly and uncontrollably for a long while. After a point I wanted to phone home and tell my parents that I would be staying out tonight because like a fool I hadn’t thought ahead and made excuses. Being apocalyptically tripping I didn’t want to use the phone in the house as I thought that people would play pranks on the other extension and there was no way was my mind flexible enough to cope with such high jinks. The idea came to me to walk to the nearest phone box, which was at the end of the street outside a string of shops. I asked for volunteers for my journey but none were forthcoming. After a period of trying to string enough sentences together to convince someone to go I decided to make the walk alone.

Reaching the payphone was suprisingly easy however it was already taken. This small setback seemed like a huge blow to my ambitions of making a phone call. Not wanting to hang around outside the shops, due to intense feelings of self-consciousness bordering on paranoia, I decided to go into a shop to waste a few moments of time. Stumbling into a off-licence I was hit by the bright fluorescent lights. I walked in squinting to see the local nutter in there being served. The man had hassled myself and a friend previously, after another acid night, on the walk home. He didn’t seem violent at all but was random, insistent and intrusive (at least last time he was).  Putting my head down pretended to be intensely interested in some crisps. The nutter left and I managed to stagger out of the shop with a drink.

I returned to the payphone to find it still full. It seemed like a long time in the shop so thinking that it was getting very late, and being a bit on edge from dealing with the ! experience alone, I decided to walk even further to another payphone which was at a junction of 5 side roads. 
I headed of down the road peering into the distance. I could see the first 20 or so yards reasonably clearly however after that it was a bit of a haze. As I focused it seemed as if the road repeated those first 20 yards endlessly into the distance. I had been walking now for what seemed like a long time and still couldn’t see the end. Suddenly I was standing at the end of the road. It opened in to a concrete clearing on which 5 roads sprang from similar in design to a cannabis leaf. I had walked down what I though  was the diagonal road second from the right, When I emerged however I was on the horizontal far right road. This confusion shocked me deeply. I just couldn’t get my head round the juxtaposition of which road I thought I should have merged from and where I was standing. After what felt like an eternity I managed to map the area in my mind and convince myself that I hadn’t flipped realities or teleported or whatever I thought was going down. 

I then proceeded onto the telephone call home. I struggled to recollect the number but finally managed to punch in something I thought was a close approximation. A women’s voice answered and I didn’t recognise it. Rather than explain “wrong number” and hang up, I was so disjointed I made a couple of inarticulate sounds and hung up. As soon as the phone disconnected I realised that it was my mother’s voice that I had just hung up on. Now in some kind of panic I struggled to find any small change and just flung in the first coin I had. I managed against the mental randomness to explain to my mother that I was staying out, I was very drunk, it was me on the last call I and had dropped the phone.

Task done I headed back to the party. As I walked back my mind, which had been taken up completely by the logistics of the phone call, began to truly wander and I realised that I couldn’t remember How old I was, what day it was, whether I was in school, sixth form or whatever. I couldn’t recollect if it was the holidays or just a normal weekend. When I tried to think of my life up to this night it seemed like abstract templates and half notions that wouldn’t stay still and definite. Through a Herculean effort I managed to sweep aside such concerns and returned to the party.

The difference between the dark and still night outside to the party inside was quite extreme. A constant background murmuring of noise, activity in almost every square inch of my visual axis, and random detached snatches of conversation drifting across my consciousness. The contrast wasn’t helped by a prank it seemed everyone in the party had decided to play on me, which was to shout my name at me as I walked in to the main lounge. The sight of dozens of faces all pissed some tripping looking at you and shouting your name while tripping yourself was not pleasant, but it was a surprise.

I managed after a short while to get back into the rhythm of the party and enjoyed myself for the next few hours. However the drama had not finished yet. I was sitting outside with a few friends in the back garden. One of their friends, who I hardly new, was a bit of a ruffian. He had also had the acid and was going a bit mental. He was talking constantly to the group pacing the garden. The group listened to him and laughed occasionally. I laughed along with the group politely while looking for an excuse to leave as it was obvious that this guy was losing it and could turn violent. Whether he could sense my uncomfortableness  or just didn’t like the look of me I don’t know, he suddenly stared at me and asked what I was laughing at. Were there was laughter it fell into intense silence. It is hard to explain the sudden dropping feeling that came over me as he made his challenge. There was laughter and a warm fuzzy feeling, then suddenly a deep dropping sensation, silence, a sudden sharp coldness, and a feeling that I was on the spot and had to respond as a failure to could result in violence, to me by him. This sudden flip of events shocked me so severely that I could only manage that I was laughing at nothing. This didn’t help matters much and it was only the intervention of mutual friends which calmed the mad fucker down. I left the garden and went inside. I managed to brush of the confrontation and enjoy the rest of the night. The ruffian later apologised for the outburst.

Sorry for the length, it has actually been quite cathartic typing out the experiences. It is hard to truly recall the feeling of being on LSD.  Even recalling this night, which is one of the clearest memories I have on LSD, seems like telling the story of the story and not the actual events themselves.

It all started on Monday. It was a public holiday and there was not much to do around the house. I turned on my laptop and talked to some friends about DXM, I thought it would be a good idea to take a gram of DXM powder to have fun for the day. I went into my bedroom at 10am and washed down 3 pills filled with pure DXM powder (a total of 1000mg of DXM). I asked my dad to take me to the shops since I thought it would be fun, then it started.

When we got to the shops, my dad said that my face was extremely red. I was getting dizzy and I felt like I was drunk. I blacked out for the next 5 minutes and then I noticed I was in the car driving home. I vomited and then blacked out again. I came back to see things flying all over my room (such as people and furniture). My sister then called the ambulance and they rushed me to hospital, while I was in the ambulance, I saw a lot awesome shapes and colors. Everything was just fun.

When we arrived at the hospital I went into this black nothingness, it was so peaceful. Like I was in another world where the real world didn't exist. I opened my eyes a few hours later to see these blobs (which were nurses). I could only see their eyebrows and mouths and it was pretty strange. Then the doctor tried to ask me a few questions, somehow I answered them but in my mind I was trapped at the other end of my bed and unable to move anything. They then moved me to the emergency ward where they tried to get me to pee, but I couldn't so they had to put a catheter in. It felt like a sadistic nympho was stabbing my penis with a pen.

The next day a small Asian doctor told me that I could go home as soon as I peed. she took the catheter out (it felt like somebody was pulling a fish hook out of my penis) but I couldn't do it, so she put one in again.

Now it was Wednesday, the DXM had worn off and the doctors were pretty sure I would be able to go. They took it out and I drank 1.7L of water. It hurt... a lot. I pressed the nurse button and they put another catheter in.

Then on Thursday (the day of me typing this) they had taken it out. I drank 1.4L of water and it hurt so they put another catheter in. The drug had worn off 2 days ago and I was still not able to pee. They sent me home with a catheter in me. And now I have to wait a week before they take it out.

I am a 21 year old female with very little drug experience. I've smoked pot and hash for 5 years now, and just recently started introducing Shrooms and Acid. This experience is about the second time I had acid, the first time was really not so intense or worth documenting on here, and the second is still fresh in my memory.

The evening began with the intentions to do shrooms and go to an all night drive in with one of my best friends K. K had called her dealer and realized he could only get LSD, so I we decided to get it anyway and see where it took us. We bought 2 hits of Acid and went back to her house with some pot, the film Waking Life, and my paints and canvases. We couldn't make it to the movie so we were having a night in. I took half of my hit at 9:30 and listened to some music, waiting for our other friend to show up. He had a car and was not on anything and wanted to go in to the city to get fast food. We listened to music and waiting for our friend S to show up. It was 10:30 when I took the other hit, and just kind of forgot about it as we went for the drive in to BK.

Like the first time on Acid, everything was positive up until this point. We were laughing about everything and I remember having such a warm fuzzy feeling all over. My face actually hurt from smiling so much. I did start to come down slightly when our friend dropped us off, as we realized it was 1am and we were alone on Acid in her room. We had paints and the movie to distract us. For about 2 hours we played around with the paint and watched the film which was mind blowing, I've seen it many times but never on Acid. 

The reason I am actually writing this experience comes down to the point where my friend fell asleep and I was left there to fall asleep. It was 3am and I was probably at my peak. I tend to worry a lot and have been on meds previously  (I went off paxil 2 years ago) for depression and anxiety. I am a lesbian and have not come out to my parents so I lots of emotional baggage, which I was quite aware could end in a disaster for my trip. The exact opposite of a disaster is what I experienced. I rehearsed what I was going to tell my parents, I worked out problems with my love life, I consoled myself and actually formed some self esteem. I felt like I was someone else viewing my life and reassessing it, I realized that so many problems I thought were so bad actually were quite fixable and small. I cried, I even threw up and saw eyes in my puke. The visuals I had were amazing, I stayed and layed in my friends spare bed from 3am to 9am when a repair man came to fix her water tank, where I fell asleep to the sound of him banging away at metal. I didn't want to fall asleep knowing he was going to show up early, but as soon as he did I was actually soothed by the loud noises. My friend woke up at 11am and had an intense headache which lasted far in to the evening. I think it probably had to do with the fact that she didn't have the brain activity that I did, I'm sure if my brain tried to sleep as it was so fucked up I would have had  a headache too.

I know I will only take half next time I do it, as the visual and nausea was not very pleasureable. I did like the therapeautic affect the LSD had on my mind, It really helped me throught my problems. I know that it is dangerous to use drugs when mentally unstable but sometimes it helps you see your life in a different perspective.

After going to the movies to celebrate my girlsfriends birthday I ran into one of her friends who we had used to hang out with a lot the last summer. We went to a lot of parties together and had smoked weed together several times. He told us about some 2ce he had that he was having difficultly moving.

I told him I wanted some but he hadn't brought any with him to the movies so I agreed to meet him the next day. But I kept this very discrete because my girlfriend expressed a disinterest and dislike of anything not weed or booze. Our friends use of some of these drugs made her uncomfortable and I didn't want to be judged or dumped but still I didn't want to miss this experience.
Even though I didn't have the foggiest about this entheogen I googled it that night and woke up with a Phd in research chemicals.

I met him the next afternoon and bought 20mg of the 2ce. I asked him how much I should take he said he usually takes it all. He said it would be ok and I trusted his wisdom because after all my familiarity with tripping was 0.

I decided it was too late to take it then because I wanted to ingest it while it was sunny so I could enjoy whatever Indore or outdoor activity I would wish.

I woke up at 7 the following morning and got ready. Dressing comfortably in shorts and a tee.  At about 10 I feel like I'm ready so I go to my room and crush the capsule on my desk picking out fragments to insure all I get is the powder. I dabbed it on my tongue with my fingers and then swirled it around my tongue.

I sit down to watch Tv when two of my buddies call me up wanted to come smoke a joint with them by this time its almost 11. I told my friends about what my girlfriends friend had given me and ask for one of them to pick me up so wouldn't have to drive. I didn't feel any effects yet but I didn't want to get risky. They arrived at my house shortly and picked me up then we drove to one of my friends houses. I was familiar with his house so I was ok with this.

We get there and smoke the joint in his backyard. 

In retrospect this could've been when the effects started. Originally I just felt myself getting high but after about two more hits it started to change. I could only pick up the effects of the weed but everything looked different just not right to me. I got very uneasy and pannicy. I didn't tell my friends though because I just thought I was just way too high. It became more difficult to follow in the conversations until eventually I just felt closed of from the other two on many levels. This closed of feeling extended to everything and the experience got more intense.

By this time I felt waves of energy washing through my body it was a very intense feeling something unlike anything else I had every felt it was magic. It was just all a little too much.

I suddenly had difficult knotting in my stomach that would come and wane but when it was noticeable it wasn't overwhelming. I expected a lot worse from reading about the body load.

I got to a point where I felt like I would lose it if I stayed here, so I got my friends to take me back to my house. They asked if I would be ok I was still confident I would be ok so I had them take me home.

[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] 

On the way back in the car I had my first several hallucinations.  I was sitting passenger and from the corner of my eye I saw my friend moving a lot so I looked over and I saw him and about 6 or 7 Travers of him they seemed to move around his figure in a triangular path. Out the windshield I looked at the road and noticed puddles in the road which was odd because it hadn't rained. When I thought of this the puddles turned to patches of a night sky with very dull stars on the road and the.clouds in the sky took on the Colorado of the pavement. As fast as the switch had came it went. I began to start feeling pretty nauseated.  Another vision came to me before I got back to my house a tree out of my window sprung trunk leaves and all out of the ground like a pop up book picture would spring up.

Once I was home I rushed upstairs to our bathroom and I threw up but I didn't feel sick anymore and the agitation I was suffering earlier seemed to clear a little but not fully.  I blame this on the intensity of the experience for me.

For the rest of the trip I stayed in my house. I sat downstairs watching Tv but I couldn't follow the program it made no sense I could tell some of the color I was perceiving wasn't the actual color in the show. The video information wasn't being processed in my state so I lost interest in Tv and went upsatirs to sit on my futon and listen to some tunes.

In my room is where I stayed for the rest of my trip because it was becoming harder for me to walk about. I put on music and felt it so fully it was insane to me. The techno music made me feel like a robot it seemed to become my identity I was the song after a few seconds of listening. The next song to come on was some screaming music I had to turn off because I felt this song the same way I had the first but the heavy music made me feel like a demonic being and I decided to just shut off the music on my laptop.

I became very sedentary after this and started to be effected by hot flashes and cold chills like a fever so I wrapped up in a quilt. The vintage patterns of my greatgrandmothers quilt had me in.awe for a while as patterns snaked and crawled. During one of these cold chills I laid back because my stomach was aching. When I closed my eyes I saw a complicated gyro-like machine free floating with many abstract shaped pieces that were all different colors.  I was stunned by the intricacy of this machine the pieces whirred like clockwork each moving the next perpetually.

I had many of these cevs and many more that resembled rangoli.

But the most notable of these cevs were these intense out of body experiences I had. One I was spectating earth before any humans I watched as in the next few seconds the world was developed civilizations and cities sprung up and metropolises formed. The most stirring part of this vision was how accurate the continents were. It was a perfect representation the types of buildings that sprung up even fit the styles of the countries they came out of.

The next most memorable vision was almost spiritual to me and it set the mood for the whole rest of my trip and has stuck with me to this day I still contemplate the meaning. I was again out of my body spectating a panoramic view of megalithic rows supported by robust columns and on these stone rows were silhouettes of a menagerie of animals I recognized the creatures were all proportionate to each other I spotted a whale, a giraffe, and a buffalo among the thousands of creatures. And among these creatures there were many I didn't recognize, some flat weren't logic with odd shaped heads some with weird growths on their head some with odd limbs like large forelegs and way smaller hindlegs. All of this came to me within a blink. The amount of information that my mind was blasting was unreal.

On the whole I enjoyed my experience with 2ce but I wouldn't do it again. Some points in my experience were too intense but never scary just very different from reality. After the trip I lost the desire to smoke weed an odd after effect. I was tired the next morning but I really didn't get more than 5 hrs sleep so I think that was the culprit. I found the 2ce experiences to incredibly introspective as well as spiritual. After the trip I felt renewed but I also felt like I lost my place in the world. I just felt off for a few weeks. But this just pushed me to quit waiting and made me start carving my own place in the world.

I was looking furiously for some information on the internet about the effects at certain doses of the LSA containing Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, which will here after be referred to as HBW for simplicity. After fruitless hours of searching, I decided to take it into my own hands to create these reviews. This particular review will serve as a walkthrough on a dose of a single HBW seed.

Preperation: The seed was scraped of its “fuzzy” outer coating as suggested by many of a resource. Then, the seed was crushed and placed in a bottle with 3 ounces of water. The mixture sat, for 1 hour, and shaken occasionally.

Note: I had a slight stomach ache prior and at the time of ingestion. Nothing to make life too uncomforatable, just noticeable.

(T+0:00) The HBW/water mixture is ingested without filtration of the substances to reduce the risk of losing any of the active ingredients that may be in the seeds. Normally I would have filtered the material out, but decided against it because of the small doseage. Tastes like chewing on dirt and leaves, or any other organic material. Slightly unpleasant. Washed the taste down with an orange soda. Will place in something more tasty next time

(T+0:20)  I am feeling slightly light headed. I am not sure if this is in my head. But the experience is pleasant.

(T+1:00)  I am feeling nothing from the one dose of HBW. Colors are slightly more vivd, but barely noticeable.

(T+4:00) I can now conclude, at least for me, that a single HBW seed does very little. Colors were slightly more vibrant. I am sure that this was not a mind game. It was slight, and if this were all I could get, it would not be worth the trouble.

I will continue with my research and plan on attempting a 2 seed dose soon, prepared in the same manner.
