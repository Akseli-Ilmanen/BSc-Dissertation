9 2c-t-7,9 - ceiling - colors - walls,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,white . at this point i really panic as i think i am going to pass out . i rush back to the couch and sit down . i comment that
9 2c-t-7,9 - ceiling - colors - walls,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,and some impending changes are even better . i spent what felt like a very long time lying back watching the pattern on the ceiling and the lights and marveling at
9 2c-t-7,9 - ceiling - colors - walls,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,eye at a few spots on the wall where paint was chipped off . i quickly looked over at the chipped spots on the wall and i could have sworn that

9 dmt,9 - ceiling - colors - walls,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was looking through a cheese cloth or something . everything seemed to be moving slower than usual . in the distance i noticed a color changing kaleidoscope of neon yellow
9 dmt,9 - ceiling - colors - walls,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,became fascinated with what was happening all around me . i looked around the room slowly watching objects fold in and out of each other . colors i had never seen

31 25i-nbome,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,25i-nbome,Serotonergic psychedelics,typical of the other for my trials . once at the peak or given the length things started to get interesting . i had been sitting watching television while waiting for

31 25i-nbome,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,25i-nbome,Serotonergic psychedelics,dead wrong about being at the peak as over the past hour the effects have slowly continued to build . the ride to the theatre was quite harrowing and at one
31 2-aminoindan,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2-aminoindan,Stimulants,is quite minimal it only provides a little ramp up and keep me there that long i would estimate plateau to last around hours bombed and hours insufflated and about minutes
31 2c-b,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,i honestly believed that it would end . after the peak i do know how long i was completely out of control for but at some point i returned to a
31 2c-b,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,DATE DATE the peak seemed to last until about hours in when i became to slowly climb back down for another hours . up until that point i had felt like
31 2c-b,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,had been doing different things since the come up started but it felt as if time had been sliced and placed at random throughout the peak . we really able to
31 2c-b,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-b,Serotonergic psychedelics,like i had gone most of the way to the peak . the cleared up quickly and my mood began to improve . i was at a high and slowly climbing
31 2c-c,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,lay back and just relax the world calmly melts having reached the summit i now slowly approach base camp . i guess it time to let the outside world in .
31 2c-c,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-c,Serotonergic psychedelics,anyways going to go back to watching freaks and geeks with my buddy for now time really has flown by . i peaked somewhere around an hour and a half or
31 2c-d,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-d,Serotonergic psychedelics,peak . oev are going nuts everythings moving swaying . the sporworks dvd is no longer trapped on my tv screen but has started to blend into the space around my
31 2c-e,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,hours of pain and heavenly bliss . as the peak started to wear off i slowly got an increased sense of groundedness that lasted longer between waves and the waves themselves
31 2c-e,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i told him i was seeing that for about an hour . another minutes pass and i still feel like i not peaking yet like there going to be more
31 2c-e,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-e,Serotonergic psychedelics,my thoughts elsewhere if i wanted it to i just chose not visuals decreased fairly rapidly as the plateau ended . then i started to get a nasty headache which mg

31 2c-i,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,and i described it briefly to at this point it felt as though i had passed my peak and i decided that i really needed to make the most of what
31 2c-i,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,what i was going to do next . the peak was building onto itself very quickly but the level clearly was about saturation of a chemical in neurons anymore . it
31 2c-i,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,how beautiful it was but i liked it this peak continued the rest of the time i watched tv and got on the net for a while still completely amazed the
31 2c-i,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-i,Serotonergic psychedelics,do really remember this but its interesting to hear about after the or so this period was pretty much like hours but i had reached a peak and stayed there until
31 2c-p,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,fuller with anything reflecting the sun leaving trails and glowing is when the effects were slowly tapering off . i was almost getting tired of the high but i generally patient
31 2c-p,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-p,Serotonergic psychedelics,where i really have to devote my day to it . i like the very slow buildup . if i had been thrown into that kind of a peak quickly i
31 2c-t-2,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,of DATE DATE about minutes into it i felt a slight alert and then a slow buildup to what you might call the peak at the hour point . the visuals
31 2c-t-2,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,in my about you rusty launched into his post trip ramble . surprised by the slow the short intense peak and the rapid comedown . as fast as the peak came
31 2c-t-2,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,to because any words i think of simply are it was like i heard much shorter than . the peak i would say lasted no longer than an hour or two
31 2c-t-2,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-2,Serotonergic psychedelics,getting any higher now . plateau lasts maybe a couple of hours and then a slow and pleasant decline to normalcy . will definitely repeat again at a slightly higher dosage
31 2c-t-4,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-4,Serotonergic psychedelics,of the peak i started to get waves in which the effect would diminish then slowly build back in again and out again . this continued for quite a while .
31 2c-t-4,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-4,Serotonergic psychedelics,mad . it worried me a lot that the trip only grew more intense as time passed . it was like it built up to a peak and then just stayed
31 2c-t-4,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-4,Serotonergic psychedelics,stayed at the peak for hours on end . i also kept getting stuck in time loops also scary . get stuck thinking about something totally nuts and just repeat thinking
31 2c-t-7,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,the point yet visual effect peak around the point and then plateau followed by a steady when i was into the plateau at about the point the effects started to increase
31 2c-t-7,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,we had definitely reached the plateau but it was coming down anytime would be a long prolonged return to baseline like acid just less a bit later and a herbal cigarette
31 2c-t-7,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,good maybe a little weaker than an hour or two ago but it been pretty steady since the peak . i have all my functions back but i still would trust
31 2c-t-7,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,2c-t-7,Serotonergic psychedelics,. the way up to the peak may be a little bumpy . some experience time dilution sic . best synth we know of have an excellent these are wise words
31 4-acetoxy-mipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-acetoxy-mipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,on grooving . my mantra became the groove . i grooved all day and then passed out early that night . DATE DATE DATE i tripping but had terrible hppd or
31 4-aco-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-aco-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,. i do know when i got to the place i ended up or how long it took or whether anything happened in between but eventually the peak came and it
31 4-aco-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-aco-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was existing at two places at once . not certain at all as to how long i was experiencing my peak . i just remember that i was still communicating with
31 4-aco-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-aco-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,this trip however nothing truly compares . i could review my mental state of the time but honestly it became irrelevant . the peak is very hard to describe . it
31 4-ho-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-ho-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,say is that i was in a state of GPE . the peak was relatively short lasting maybe minutes or so but the comedown was also very pleasant . all this
31 4-ho-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-ho-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,feel the peak subsiding already . effects are still strong but the highest peak has passed . i smoke a couple of small hits of we watched ' animation . the
31 4-ho-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-ho-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,just relaxed it will be beautiful . it is what it is . i have passed the peak and am slowly coming down . still but the intrusive energy felt earlier
31 4-ho-mipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-ho-mipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,so i apologise as i wo nt be able to give much information on the length of the plateau . i tried to roll a spliff but this made me realise
31 4-ho-mipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,4-ho-mipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,now the sea state has moderated and visibility has improved the GPE squall line has passed and there is a calm descending . still feeling very relaxed and content though .
31 5-meo-amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,with a ' sub in the back or maybe we were just going speed lightning fast will also add that the beginning of the trip i felt like jumping out of
31 5-meo-amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the hour mark and continues climbing until about . then the peak lasts an unbelievably long time and i usually come down the next t pm we consume the t i
31 5-meo-amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,continues to climb until the hour mark and stays there for about hours . then slowly subsides over the next it was at this placeholder that it actually peaked . the
31 5-meo-amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,i was at the plateau until . for some reason this chemical does not like time . it distorts your sense of time to the point that it feels like you
31 5-meo-dalt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dalt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and relatively unknown . after the peak effects had been going on for hours they slowly faded away and i came back to baseline and to a sense of feeling very
31 5-meo-dalt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dalt,Serotonergic psychedelics,valley flowing into the summit of the peak we weighed out our doses cheers a quick onset for this material within minutes i was sensing something . describing this ' becomes
31 5-meo-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,like we hit a plateau and stayed there with only tiny perceptible valleys for the duration . it had been a long time since i had entered any tryptamine space that
31 5-meo-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,equivalent effects of nearly still experiencing a still in the sustained peak but i have passed the slowly dimishing but quite high by normal reality back to i am pleased to
31 5-meo-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,before . when i started this i started getting white flashes of light . the faster and fatter i played the brighter the i kept doing this until i peaked and
31 5-meo-dipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,the intensity of our peaks under the safety of isolation . this was definitely the time when we all peaked the highest . we leaned up against the support of the
31 5-meo-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,to vibrate and thought i better close my eyes . i can not say how long that peak lasted but it seemed to last forever . i did know if i
31 5-meo-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,was new to both of us . i knew that the peak would come on slower and remain longer but i still did know what to expect . i railed the
31 5-meo-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,lesser strength . then abruptly i was dropped out of the peak although much more slowly then if i had smoked the . smaller waves continued for approx . minutes until
31 5-meo-dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,there . this placeholder the onset was like an straight angle the peak was very long and consisted mostly of vibrating in when the the trip was about to be over
31 5-meo-mipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-mipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,peak was a spike then things dropped down to a cozy managable level for a slow . body chills echoes air felt overwhelming . all sensory input was amplified though tactile
31 5-meo-mipt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,5-meo-mipt,Serotonergic psychedelics,think i was reaching to the plateau and i had some wavy visuals . also time felt less important and i was not really conscious in the same way . my
31 6-apb,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,6-apb,Entactogens,perhaps an hour and a half later . the absolute peak was generous in its length sometimes thirty or more minutes followed by a slightly decreased plateau of perhaps an hour

31 amphetamine,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,amphetamine,Stimulants,peaked for about minutes and then it was clear it was going to recede very slowly . with a guilty heart had to tell my friends that our big night out
31 amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a few times when i think it might keep getting more but it so i quickly go back to being some chilled out peak this lasts a long time . at
31 amt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,amt,Serotonergic psychedelics,a plateau rather than a peak because it stays at the same intensity for a long time . by this placeholder r was tired and since we did not seem like

31 argyreia nervosa,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,me that i was having a good trip i felt that the peak had already passed and i was going to be ok from that moment on . i said something
31 argyreia nervosa,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,to peak so if you are planning a sunset in the nature preserve or anything time it wisely . do your research please people this is not high ' . it
31 argyreia nervosa,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,very positive . i am a giant fan . i would further say that the period of time between hours before and after the peak for hours total is probably a
31 argyreia nervosa,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,argyreia nervosa,Serotonergic psychedelics,the effects seems to have spoiled my hopes for that . my experience came on quickly which is unlike most lsa experiences but the peak was uneven . i thought the

31 cannabis spp.,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,cannabis spp.,Depressant / sedatives,similar to that . i was so confused at the peak of this high and time was so distorted that i wo try and recall it linearly but rather document the

31 datura spp.,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,datura spp.,Deliriants,the peak effects are after each toke though in total i think it wears off slower but more clearly . other than that i have been reading datura rapports of all

31 dmt,31 - peak - plateau - baseline,dmt,Serotonergic psychedelics,and the peaks lasted probably each . again it was very difficult to maintain a timeline or judge time spans . i wrote the notes minutes after coming down the last
